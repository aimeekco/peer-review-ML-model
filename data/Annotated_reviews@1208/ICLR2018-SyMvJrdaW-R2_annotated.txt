"Paper proposes a shallow model for approximating stacks of Resnet layers, based on mathematical approximations to the Resnet equations and experimental insights, and uses this technique to train Resnet-like models in half the time on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] While the experiments are not particularly impressive,[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I liked the originality of this paper.
