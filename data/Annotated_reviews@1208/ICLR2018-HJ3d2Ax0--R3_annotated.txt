"The paper proposes to use the start-end rank to measure the long-term dependency in RNNs.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] It shows that deep RNN is signficantly better than shallow one in this metric.[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThe theory part seems to be technical enough and interesting,[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] though I haven't checked all the details[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]. The main concern with the paper is that I am not sure whether the RAC studied by the paper is realistic enough for practice. [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,EXT-NEG], [null], [SUG,DIS,FBK], [GEN]]Certain gating in RNN is very useful but I don't know whether one can train any reasonable RNN with all multiplicative gates[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]. The paper will be much stronger if it has some experiments along this line. "[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,EXT-NEU], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT,FBK], [GEN]]
