"This paper proposes a deep learning architecture for joint learning of feature representation, a target-task mapping function, and a sample re-weighting function.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Specifically, the method tries to discover feature representations, which are invariance in different domains, by minimizing the re-weighted empirical risk and distributional shift between designs.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\nOverall, the paper is well written and organized with good description on the related work, research background, and theoretic proofs.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThe main contribution can be the idea of learning a sample re-weighting function, which is highly important in domain shift.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] However, as stated in the paper, since the causal effect of an intervention T on Y conditioned on X is one of main interests, it is expected to add the related analysis in the experiment section."[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
