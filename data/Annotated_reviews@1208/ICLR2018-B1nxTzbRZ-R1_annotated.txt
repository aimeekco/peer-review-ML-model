"The paper considers a problem of predicting hidden information in a poMDP with an application to Starcraft.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MIN]] \nAuthors propose a number of baseline models as well as metrics to assess the quality of \u201cdefogging\u201d.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MIN]] \n\nI find the problem of defogging quite interesting, even though it is a bit too Starcraft-specific some findings could perhaps be translated to other partially observed environments.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nAuthors use the dataset provided for Starcraft: Brood war by Lin et al, 2017.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MIN]]\n\nMy impression about the paper is that even though it touches a very interesting problem,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] it neither is written well nor it contains much of a novelty in terms of algorithms, methods or network architectures.[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nDetailed comments:\n* Authors should at very least cite (Vinyals et al, 2017) and explain why the environment and the dataset released for Starcraft 2 is less suited than the one provided by Lin et al.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG,DFT], [MAJ]]\n* Problem statement in section 3.1 should certainly be improved.[[CNT], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] Authors introduce rather heavy notation which is then used in a confusing way.[[CNT], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, what is the top index in $s_t^{3-p}$ supposed to mean?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] The notation is not much used after sec. 3.1, for example, figure 1 does not use it.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n* A related issue, is that the definition of metrics is very informal and, again, does not use the already defined notation.[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Including explicit formulas would be very helpful, because, for example, it looks like when reported in table 1 the metrics are spatially averaged, yet I could not find an explicit notion of that.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n* Authors seem to only consider deterministic defogging models.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] However, to me it seems that even in 15 game steps the uncertainty over the hidden state is quite high and thus any deterministic model has a very limited potential in prediction it.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] At least the concept of stochastic predictions should be discussed\n* The rule-based baselines are not described in detail.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUb-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] What does \u201cusing game rules to infer the existence of unit types\u201d mean?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n* Another detail which I found missing is whether authors use just a screen, a mini-map or both.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] In the game of Starcraft, only screen contains information about unit-types, but it\u2019s field of view is limited.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Hence, it\u2019s unclear to me whether a model should infer hidden information based on just a single screen + minimap observation (or a history of them) or due to how the dataset is constructed, all units are observed without spatial limitations of the screen. \n"[[MET-NEG,DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
