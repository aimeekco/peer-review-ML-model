"The authors adapts stochastic natural gradient methods for variational inference with structured inference networks.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The variational approximation proposed is similar to SVAE by Jonhson et al. (2016), but rather than directly using the global variable theta in the local approximation for x the authors propose to optimize a separate variational parameter.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors then extends and adapts the natural gradient method by Khan & Lin (2017) to optimize all the variational parameters.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] In the experiments the authors generally show improved convergence over SVAE.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe idea seems promising[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but it is still a bit unclear to me why removing dependence between global and local parameters that you know is there would lead to a better variational approximation.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS,CRT], [MIN]] The main motivation seems to be that it is easier to optimize.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n- In the last two sentences of the updates for \\theta_PGM you mention that you need to do SVI/VMP to compute the function \\eta_x\\theta.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Might this also suffer from non-convergence issues like you argue SVAE does?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Or do you simply mean that computation of this is exact using regular message passing/Kalman filter/forward-backward?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- It was not clear to me why we should use a Gaussian approximation for the \\theta_NN parameters?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] The prior might be Gaussian but the posterior is not?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] Is this more of a simplifying assumption?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- There has recently been interest in using inference networks as part of more flexible variational approximations for structured models.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [CNT], [CNT]] Some examples of related work missing in this area is \"Variational Sequential Monte Carlo\" by Naesseth et al.
