"This paper proposes a model of \"structured alignments\" between sentences as a means of comparing two sentences by matching their latent structures.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Overall, this paper seems a straightforward application of the model first proposed by Kim et al. 2017 with latent tree attention[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MAJ]].\n\nIn section 3.1, the formula for p(c|x) looks wrong: c_{ijk} are indicator variables.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] but where are the scores for each span?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] I think it should be c_{ijk} * \\delta_{ijk} under the summations instead.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nIn the same section, the expression for \\alpha_{ij} seems to assume that \\delta_{ijk} = \\dlta_{ij} regardless of k. I.e. there are no production rule scores (transitions).[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] This seems rather limiting, can you comment on that?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nIn the answer selection and NLI experiments, the proposed model does not beat the SOTA, and is only marginally better than unstructured decomposable attention. This is rather disappointing.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] \n\nThe plots in Fig 2 with the marginals on CKY charts are not very enlightening.[[TNF-NEG], [IMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]] How do this marginals help solving the NLI task?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\nMinor comments:\n- Sec. 3: \"Language is inherently tree structured\" -- this is debatable...[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- page 8: (laf, 2008): bad formatted reference"[[BIB-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]]
