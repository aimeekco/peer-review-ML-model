"The paper proves the weak convergence of the regularised OT problem to Kantorovich / Monge optimal transport problems.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nI like the weak convergence results, but this is just weak convergence.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It appears to be an overstatement to claim that the approach \"nearly-optimally\" transports one distribution to the other (Cf e.g. Conclusion).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] There is a penalty to pay for choosing a small epsilon -- it seems to be visible from Figure 2.[[TNF-NEU], [null], [CRT], [MIN]] Also, near-optimality would refer to some parameters being chosen in the best possible way.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] I do not see that from the paper.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] However, the weak convergence results are good.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nA better result, hinting on how \"optimal\" this can be, would have been to guarantee that the solution to regularised OT is within f(epsilon) from the optimal one, or from within f(epsilon) from the one with a smaller epsilon (more possibilities exist).[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] This is one of the things experimenters would really care about -- the price to pay for regularisation compared to the unknown unregularized optimum.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nI also like the choice of the two regularisers and wonder whether the authors have tried to make this more general, considering other regularisations ? [[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]After all, the L2 one is just an approximation of the entropic one.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nTypoes:\n\n1- Kanthorovich -> Kantorovich (Intro)\n2- Cal C <-> C (eq. 4)"[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
