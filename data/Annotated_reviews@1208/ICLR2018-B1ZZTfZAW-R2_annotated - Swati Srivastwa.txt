"In this paper, the authors propose a recurrent GAN architecture that generates continuous domain sequences.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] To accomplish this, they use a generator LSTM that takes in a sequence of random noise as well as a sequence of conditonal information and outputs a sequence.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The discriminator LSTM takes a sequence (and conditional information) as input and classifies each element of the sequence as real or synthetic -- the entire sequence is then classified by vote.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors evaluate on several synthetic tasks, as well as an ICU timeseries data task.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nOverall, I thought the paper was clearly written and extremely easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] To the best of my knowledge, the method proposed by the authors is novel, and differs from traditional sentence generation (as an example) models because it is intended to produce continuous domain outputs.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS,CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Furthermore, the story of generating medical training data for public release is an interesting use case for a model like this, particularly since training on synthetic data appears to achieve not competitive but quite reasonable accuracy, even when the model is trained in a differentially private fashion.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nMy most important piece of feedback is that I think it would be useful to include a few examples of the eICU time series data, both real and synthetic.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]] This might give a better sense of: (1) how difficult the task is, (2) how much variation there is in the real data from patient to patient, and (3) how much variation we see in the synthetic time series.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]  Are the synthetic time series clearly multimodal, or do they display some of the mode collapse behavior occasionally seen in GANs?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\nI would additionally like to see a few examples of the time series data at both the 5 minute granularity and the 15 minute granularity.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  You claim that downsampling the data to 15 minute time steps still captures the relevant dynamics of the data -- is it obvious from the data that variations in the measured variables are not significant over a 5 minute interval?[[DAT-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  As it stands, this is somewhat an unknown, and should be easy enough to demonstrate."[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
