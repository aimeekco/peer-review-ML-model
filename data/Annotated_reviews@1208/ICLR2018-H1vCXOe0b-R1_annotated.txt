"The paper intends to interpret a well-trained multi-class classification deep neural network by discovering the core units of one or multiple hidden layers for prediction making.[[INT-NEU,EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, these discovered core units are specific to a particular class, which are retained to maintain the deep neural network\u2019s ability to separate that particular class from the other ones.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Thus, these non-core units for a particular class could be core units for separating another class from the remaining ones.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Consequently, the aggregation of all class-specific core units could include all hidden units of a layer.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Therefore, it is hard for me to understand what\u2019s the motivation to identify the core units in a one-vs-remaining manner.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] At this moment, these identified class-specific core units are useful for neither reducing the size of the network, nor accelerating computation.
