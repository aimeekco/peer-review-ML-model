"The main strength of this paper, I think, is the theoretical result in Theorem 1[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. This result is quite nice.[[RES-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] I wish the authors actually concluded with the following minor improvement to the proof that actually strengthens the result further.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nThe authors ended the discussion on thm 1 on page 7 (just above Sec 2.3) by saying what is sufficiently close to w*.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] If one goes back to (10), it is easy to see that what converges to w* when one of three things happen (assuming beta is fixed once loss L is selected).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n1) k goes to infinity\n2) alpha goes to 1\n3) g(w*) goes to 0[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe authors discussed how alpha is close to 1 by virtue of submodular optimization lower bounds there for what is close to w*.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] In fact this proof shows the situation is much better than that.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-POS], [SMY], [MAJ]] \n\nIf we are really concerned about making what converge to w*, and if we are willing to tolerate the increasing computational complexity associated solving submodular problems with larger k, we can schedule k to increase over time which guarantees that both alpha goes to 1 and g(w*) goes to zero.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] \n\nThere is also a remark that G(A) tends to be modular when lambda is small which is useful.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\nFrom the algorithm, it seems clear that the authors recognized these two useful aspects of the objective and scheduled lambda to decrease exponentially and k to increase linearly.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]]\n\nIt would be really nice to complete the analysis of Thm1 with a formal analysis of convergence speed for ||what-w*|| as lambda and k are scheduled in this fashion. [[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]Such an analysis would help practitioners make better choices for the hyper parameters gamma and Delta."[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
