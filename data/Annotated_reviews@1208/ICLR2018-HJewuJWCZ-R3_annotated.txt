"This paper suggests a \"learning to teach\" framework. Following a similar intuition as self-paced learning and curriculum learning, the authors suggest to learn a teaching strategy,  corresponding to choices over the data presented to the learner (and potentially other decisions  about the learner, such as the  algorithm used). [[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The problem is framed as RL problem, where the state space corresponds to learning configurations, and teacher actions change the state.  Supervision is obtained by observing the learner's performance.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  \n\nI found it very difficult to understand the evaluation.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]   \nFirst, there is quite a bit of recent work on learning to teach and curriculum learning.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]   It would be helpful if there are comparisons to these models, and use similar datasets. [[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  It's not clear if an evaluation on the MNIST data set is particularly meaningful. [[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]    The implementation of SPL seems to hurt performance in some cases (slower convergence on the IMDB dataset), can you explain it?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]    In other text learning task (e.g., [1]) SPL showed improved performance.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]     The results over the IMDB dataset in the original paper [2] are higher than the ones reported here, using a simple model (BoW).[[DAT-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]   \nSecond, in non-convex problems, one can expect curriculum learning approaches to also perform better, not just converge faster. [[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This aspect is not really discussed.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  Finally,  I'm not sure I understand the X axis in Figure 2, the (effective) number of examples is much higher than the size of the dataset.[[DAT-NEU,TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Does it indicate the number of  iterations over the same dataset?[[DAT-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\nI would also like to see some analysis of what's actually being learned by the teacher.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]] Some qualitative analysis, or even feature ablation study would be helpful.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n[1] Easy Questions First?
