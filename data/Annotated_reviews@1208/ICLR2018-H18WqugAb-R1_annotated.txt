"This paper focuses on the zero-shot learning compositional capabilities of modern sequence-to-sequence RNNs.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  Through a series of experiments and a newly defined dataset, it exposes the short-comings of current seq2seq RNN architectures.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The proposed dataset, called the SCAN dataset, is a selected subset of the CommonAI navigation tasks data set.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  This subset is chosen such that each command sequence corresponds to exactly one target action sequence, making it possible to apply standard seq2seq methods.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Existing methods are then compared based on how accurately they can produce the target action sequence based on the command input sequence.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe introduction covers relevant literature and nicely describes the motivation for later experiments.[[INT-POS,RWK-POS,EXP-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Description of the model architecture is largely done in the appendix, this puts the focus of the paper on the experimental section.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This choice seems to be appropriate, since standard methods are used.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Figure 2 is sufficient to illustrate the model to readers familiar with the literature.[[MET-NEU,TNF-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe experimental part establishes a baseline using standard seq2seq models on the new dataset, by exploring large variations of model architectures and a large part of the hyper-parameter space.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]   This papers experimentation sections sets a positive example by exploring a comparatively large space of standard model architectures on the problem it proposes.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] This search enables the authors to come to convincing conclusions regarding the shortcomings of current models.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The paper explores in particular:\n1.) Model generalization to unknown data similar to the training set.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n2.) Model generalization to data-sequences longer than the training set.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n3.) Generalization to composite commands, where  a part of the command is never observed in sequence in the training set.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n4.) A recreation of a similar problem in the machine translation context.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThese experiments show that modern sequence to sequence models do not solve the systematicity problem, while making clear by application to machine translation, why such a solution would be desirable. [[EXP-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]The SCAN data-set has the potential to become an interesting test-case for future research in this direction.[[DAT-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe experimental results shown in this paper are clearly compelling in exposing the weaknesses of current seq2seq RNN models.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  However, where the paper falls a bit short is in the discussion / outlook in terms of suggestions of how one can go about tackling these shortcomings.
