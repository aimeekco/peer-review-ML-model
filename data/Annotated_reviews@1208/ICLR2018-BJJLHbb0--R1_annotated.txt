"1. This is a good paper, makes an interesting algorithmic contribution in the sense of joint clustering-dimension reduction for unsupervised anomaly detection\n2.[[OAL-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It demonstrates clear performance improvement via comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods\n3.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Is the number of Gaussian Mixtures 'K' a hyper-parameter in the training process?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] can it be a trainable parameter?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n4. Also, it will be interesting to get some insights or anecdotal evidence on how the joint learning helps beyond the decoupled learning framework, such as what kind of data points (normal and anomalous) are moving apart due to the joint learning  "[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
