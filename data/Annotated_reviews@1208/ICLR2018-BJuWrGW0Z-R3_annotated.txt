"The authors present 3 architectures for learning representations of programs from execution traces.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In the variable trace embedding, the input to the model is given by a sequence of variable values.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The state trace embedding combines embeddings for variable traces using a second recurrent encoder.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The dependency enforcement embedding performs element-wise multiplication of embeddings for parent variables to compute the input of the GRU to compute the new hidden state of a variable.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors evaluate their architectures on the task of predicting error patterns for programming assignments from Microsoft DEV204.1X (an introduction to C# offered on edx) and problems on the Microsoft CodeHunt platform.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They additionally use their embeddings to decrease the search time for the Sarfgen program repair system.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThis is a fairly strong paper.[[OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The proposed models make sense and the writing is for the most part clear, though there are a few places where ambiguity arises:[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n- The variable \"Evidence\" in equation (4) is never defined.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] \n\n- The authors refer to \"predicting the error patterns\", but again don't define what an error pattern is.[[MET-NEG], [SUb-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The appendix seems to suggest that the authors are simply performing multilabel classification based on a predefined set of classes of errors, is this correct?[[CNT], [CNT], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\n- It is not immediately clear from Figures 3 and 4 that the architectures employed are in fact recurrent.[[TNF-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n- Figure 5 seems to suggest that dependencies are only enforced at points in a program where assignment is performed for a variable, is this correct?\[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]n\nAssuming that the authors can address these clarity issues, I would in principle be happy for the paper to appear.
