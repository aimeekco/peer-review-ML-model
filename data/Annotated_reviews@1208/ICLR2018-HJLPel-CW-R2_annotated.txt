"In this paper, the authors proposed a method to transfer the text style to a specific target style.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] To this end, the authors combined a text reconstruction loss, an adversarial decoding loss, a cyclic consistency loss and a style discrepancy loss.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The method seems solid, and the writing is pretty good.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] But there are a few key issues that are not clearly addressed and the experimental results are not convincing.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nPros:\nThis method combines the contributions of a few previous works, and obtains a stronger and more general model.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Especially it borrows the cyclic loss from the image style transfer, which provides a reasonable regularization to the text style transfer model.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nCons:\nThere are a few key technical issues that are not clearly addressed.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Hence I'm not fully convinced that this model indeed works as claimed.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n1. Why use CNN for the style representation layer?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] CNN is known to be usually unable to capture long-range correlations in natural language (unless enhanced with attentions).[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Are long-range correlations irrelevant to the text style?[[EXT-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]\n2. The authors made an essential assumption that all target samples have the same style embedding y*.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] But seems none of the 4 loss functions incorporates this constraint.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] If y* is simply fixed somewhere in the model, then I'm worried that it may cause mode collapse (i.e. the encoder always output similar values), and one possible bad consequence is that y1_i of different sentences in the source domain may have very similar values.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n3. The experiments are toyish and not convincing.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The given examples seem to exhibit certain kind of mode collapse, i.e. different examples have similar wording from a very limited vocabulary.[[CNT], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It is possible that the generator just learned to overfit the sentiment classifier, so that the classifier thought the transferred sentences have the desired sentiment, but the transferred sentences may lack variations and hence lacks practical use.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It would be convincing if the authors could transfer an English paragraph into the style of a certain author, such as Shakespeare, which can be easily evaluated by a human instead of a trained classifier."[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
