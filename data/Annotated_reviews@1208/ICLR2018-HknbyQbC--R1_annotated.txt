"I thank the authors for the thoughtful response and rebuttal. [[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]The authors have substantially updated their manuscript and improved the presentation.[[RWK-NEG], [IMP-NEG,PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nRe: Speed. I brought up this point because this was a bulleted item in the Introduction in the earlier version of the manuscript.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In the revised manuscript, this bullet point is now removed.[[RWK-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]] I will take this point to be moot.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nRe: High resolution.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors point to recent GAN literature that provides some first results with high resolution GANs but I do not see quantitative evidence in the high resolution setting for this paper.[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG,OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]] (Figure 4 provides qualitative examples from ImageNet but no quantitative assessment.[[RWK-NEU,TNF-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]])\n\nBecause the authors improved the manuscript, I upwardly revised my score to 'Ok but not good enough - rejection'.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] I am not able to accept this paper because of the latter point.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]\n==========================\n\nThe authors present an interesting new method for generating adversarial examples. [[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]Namely, the author train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to adversarial examples for a target network.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors demonstrate that the network works well in the semi-white box and black box settings.[[RWK-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe authors wrote a clear paper with great references and clear descriptions.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nMy primary concern is that this work has limited practical benefit in a realistic setting.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Addressing each and every concern is quite important:\n\n1) Speed.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors suggest that training a GAN provides a speed benefit with respect to other attack techniques.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,SUG], [GEN]] The FGSM method (Goodfellow et al, 2015) is basically 1 inference operation and 1 backward operation.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The GAN is 1 forward operation.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Granted this results in a small difference in timing 0.06s versus 0.01s, however it would seem that avoiding a backward pass is a somewhat small speed gain.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n \nFurthermore, I would want to question the practical usage of having an 'even faster' method for generating adversarial examples.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] What is the reason that we need to run adversarial attacks 'even faster'?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] I am not aware of any use-cases, but if there are some, the authors should describe the rationales at length in their paper.[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n2) High spatial resolution images. [[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]Previous methods, e.g. FGSM, may work on arbitrarily sized images.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] At best, GANs generate reasonable images that are lower resolutions (e.g. < 128x128).[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Building GAN's that operate above-and-beyond moderate spatial resolution is an open research topic.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The best GAN models for generating high resolution images are  difficult to train and it is not clear if they would work in this setting.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Furthermore, images with even higher resolutions, e.g. 512x512, which is quite common in ImageNet, are difficult to synthesizes using current techniques.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n3) Controlling the amount of distortion.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A feature of previous optimization based methods is that a user may specify the amount of perturbation (epsilon).[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] This is a key feature if not requirement in an adversarial perturbation because a user might want to examine the performance of a given model as a function of epsilon.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Performing such an analysis with this model is challenging (i.e. retraining a GAN) and it is not clear if a given image generated by a GAN will always achieve a given epsilon perturbation/\n\nOn a more minor note, the authors suggest that generating a *diversity* of adversarial images is of practical import. [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]I do not see the utility of being able to generate a diversity of adversarial images.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The authors need to provide more justification for this motivation.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]"
