"This paper explores the idea of adding parameter space noise in service of exploration.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The paper is very well written and quite clear.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  It does a good job of contrasting parameter space noise to action space noise and evolutionary strategies.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nHowever, the results are weak.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Parameter noise does better in some Atari + Mujoco domains, but shows little difference in most domains.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  The domains where parameter noise (as well as evolutionary strategies) does really well are Enduro and the Chain environment, in which a policy that repeatedly chooses a particular action will do very well.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  E-greedy approaches will always struggle to choose the same random action repeatedly.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  Chain is great as a pathological example to show the shortcomings of e-greedy, but few interesting domains exhibit such patterns.[[BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  Similarly for the continuous control with sparse rewards environments \u2013 if you can construct an environment with sparse enough reward that action-space noise results in zero rewards, then clearly parameter space noise will have a better shot at learning.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]  However, for complex domains with sparse reward (e.g. Montezuma\u2019s Revenge) parameter space noise is just not going to get you very far.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nOverall, I think parameter space noise is a worthy technique to have analyzed and this paper does a good job doing just that.[[MET-POS,ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  However, I don\u2019t expect this technique to make a large splash in the Deep RL community, mainly because simply adding noise to the parameter space doesn\u2019t really gain you much more than policies that are biased towards particular actions.[[MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Parameter noise is not a very smart form of exploration, but it should be acknowledged as a valid alternative to action-space noise.[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nA non-trivial amount of work has been done to find a sensible way of adding noise to parameter space of a deep network and defining the specific distance metrics and thresholds for (dual-headed) DQN, DDPG, and TRPO.\n"[[ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]
