"This paper proposes to use 3D conditional GAN models to generate\nfMRI scans.[[INT-NEU,CNT], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Using the generated images, paper reports improvement\nin classification accuracy on various tasks.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]]\n\nOne claim of the paper is that a generative model of fMRI\ndata can help to caracterize and understand variability of scans\nacross subjects.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nArticle is based on recent works such as Wasserstein GANs and AC-GANs\nby (Odena et al., 2016).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nDespite the rich literature of this recent topic the related work\nsection is rather convincing.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nModel presented extends IW-GAN by using 3D convolution and also\nby supervising the generator using sample labels.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]1\n\nMajor:\n\n- The size of the generated images is up to 26x31x22 which is limited\n(about half the size of the actual resolution of fMRI data).[[RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] As a\nconsequence results on decoding learning task using low resolution\nimages can end up worse than with the actual data (as pointed out).[[DAT-NEU,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nWhat it means is that the actual impact of the work is probably limited.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n- Generating high resolution images with GANs even on faces for which\nthere is almost infinite data is still a challenge.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Here a few thousand\ndata points are used.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] So it raises too concerns: First is it enough?[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\nUsing so-called learning curves is a good way to answer this.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Second\nis what are the contributions to the state-of-the-art of the 2\nmethods introduced?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Said differently, as there\nis no classification results using images produced by an another\nGAN architecture it is hard to say that the extra complexity\nproposed here (which is a bit contribution of the work) is actually\nnecessary.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nMinor:\n\n- Fonts in figure 4 are too small.\n"[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
