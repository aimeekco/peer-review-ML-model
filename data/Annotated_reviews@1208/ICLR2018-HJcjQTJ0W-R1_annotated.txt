"1. This is an interesting paper - introduces useful concepts such as the formulation of the utility and privacy loss functions with respect to the learning paradigm\n2.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] From the initial part of the paper, it seems that the proposed PrivyNet is supposed to be a meta-learning framework to split a DNN in order to improve privacy while maintaining a certain accuracy level\n3.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] However, the main issue is that the meta-learning mechanism is a bit ad-hoc and empirical - therefore not sure how seamless and user-friendly it will be in general, it seems it needs empirical studies for every new application - this basically involves generation of a pareto front and then choose pareto-optimal points based on the user's requirements, but it is unclear how a privy net construction based on some data set considered from the internet has the ability to transfer and help in maintaining privacy in another type of data set, e.g., social media pictures"[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
