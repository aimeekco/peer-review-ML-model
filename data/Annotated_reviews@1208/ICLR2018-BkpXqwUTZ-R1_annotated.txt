"- This paper is not well written and incomplete.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] There is no clear explanation of what exactly the authors want to achieve in the paper, what exactly is their approach/contribution, experimental setup, and analysis of their results. [[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n- The paper is hard to read due to many abbreviations, e.g., the last paragraph in page 2.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n- The format is inconsistent. Section 1 is numbered, but not the other sections.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n- in page 2, what do the numbers mean at the end of each sentence? Probably the figures? [[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n- in page 2, \"in this figure\": which figure is this referring to?[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n\nComments on prior work:\n\np 1: authors write: \"vanilla backpropagation (VBP)\" \"was proposed around 1987 Rumelhart et al. (1985).[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\" \n\nNot true. A main problem with the 1985 paper is that it does not cite the inventors of backpropagation.[[RWK-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]] The VBP that everybody is using now is the one published by  Linnainmaa in 1970, extending Kelley's work of 1960.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] The first to publish the application of VBP to NNs was Werbos in 1982. Please correct. [[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\np 1: authors write: \"Almost at the same time, biologically inspired convolutional networks was also introduced as well using VBP LeCun et al. (1989).[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\"\n\nHere one must cite the person who really invented this biologically inspired convolutional architecture (but did not apply backprop to it): Fukushima (1979). He is cited later, but in a misleading way. Please correct.[[RWK-POS,BIB-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT,DIS], [MIN]]\n\np 1: authors write: \"Deep learning (DL) was introduced as an approach to learn deep neural network architecture using VBP LeCun et al. (1989; 2015); Krizhevsky et al. (2012).[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\" \n\nNot true. Deep Learning was introduced by Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965: the first working method for learning in multilayer perceptrons of arbitrary depth. Please correct.(The term \"deep learning\" was introduced to ML in 1986 by Dechter for something else.)[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\np1: authors write: \"Extremely deep networks learning reached 152 layers of representation with residual and highway networks He et al. (2016); Srivastava et al. (2015).[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\" \n\nHighway networks were published half a year earlier than resnets, and reached many hundreds of layers before resnets. Please correct.[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]\n\n\nGeneral recommendation: Clear rejection for now.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]] But perhaps the author want to resubmit this to another conference, taking into account the reviewer comments.\n\n"[[EXT-POS], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]
