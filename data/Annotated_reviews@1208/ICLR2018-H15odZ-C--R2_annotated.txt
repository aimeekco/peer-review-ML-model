"The authors discuss a direct Gamma sampling method for the interpolated samples in GANs, and show the improvements over usual normal sampling for CelebA, MNIST, CIFAR and SVHN datasets.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS,DAT-POS,MET-POS,ANA-POS], [SUB-POS,IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe method involves a nice, albeit minor, trick, where the chi-squared distribution of the sum of the z_{i}^{2} has its dependence on the dimensionality removed[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. However I am not convinced by the distribution of \\|z^\\prime\\|^{2} in the first place (eqn (2)): the samples from the gaussian will be approximately orthogonal in high dimensions, but the inner product will be at least O(1)[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. Thus although the \\|z_{0}\\|^{2} and \\|z_{1}\\|^{2} are chi-squared/gamma, I don't think \\|z^\\prime\\|^{2} is exactly gamma in general.[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nThe experiments do show that the interpolated samples are qualitatively better, but a thorough empirical analysis for different dimensionalities would be welcome.[[RWK-POS,DAT-POS,EXP-POS,ANA-POS], [SUB-POS,IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Figures 2 and 3 do not add anything to the story, since 2 is just a plot of gamma pdfs and 3 shows the difference between the constant KL and the normal case that is linear in d. [[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nOverall I think the trick needs to be motivated better, and the experiments improved to really show the import of the d-independence of the KL.[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS,ANA-POS], [IMP-POS,CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Thus I think this paper is below the acceptance threshold."[[INT-NEG,RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [REC-NEG], [CRT,FBK], [MIN]]
