"This paper can be seen as an extension of the paper \"attention is all you need\" that will be published at nips in a few weeks (at the time I write this review).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe goal here is to make the target sentence generation non auto regressive.[[PDI-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors propose to introduce a set of latent variables to represent the fertility of each source words.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]] The number of target words can be then derived and they're all predicted in parallel.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe idea is interesting and trendy.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the paper is not really stand alone.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] A lot of tricks are stacked to reduce the performance degradation.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] However, they're sometimes to briefly described to be understood by most readers.[[RES-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nThe training process looks highly elaborate with a lot of hyper parameters.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Maybe you could comment on this.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]] \n\nFor instance, the use fertility supervision during training could be better motivated and explained.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]] Your choice of IBM 2 is wired since it doesn't include fertility.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Why not IBM 4, for instance ?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] How you use IBM model for supervision.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] This a simple example, but a lot of things in this paper is too briefly described and their impact not really evaluated.
