"In this paper the author propose a CNN based solution for somatic mutation calling at ultra low allele frequencies.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe tackled problem is a hard task in computational biology, and the proposed solution Kittyhawk, although designed with very standard ingredients (several layers of CNN inspired to the VGG structure), seems to be very effective on both the shown datasets.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [GEN]]\nThe paper is well written (up to a few misprints), the introduction and the biological background very accurate (although a bit technical for the broader audience) and the bibliography reasonably complete.[[INT-POS,RWK-POS,BIB-NEU], [CLA-POS], [APC], [GEN]] Maybe the manuscript part with the definition of the accuracy measures may be skipped.[[INT-NEU], [CNT], [DIS], [GEN]] Moreover, the authors themselves suggest how to proceed along this line of research with further improvements.[[FWK-POS], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\nI would only suggest to expand the experimental section with further (real) examples to strengthen the claim.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\nOverall, I rate this manuscript in the top 50% of the accepted papers."[[OAL-NEU], [null], [FBK], [MAJ]]
