"In this contribution, the authors propose an improvement of a tensor decomposition method for decoding spike train.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Relying on a non-negative matrix factorization, the authors tackle the influence of the baseline activity on the decomposition.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The main consequence is that the retrieved components are not necessarily non-negative and the proposed decomposition rely on signed activation coefficients.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] An experimental validation shows that for high frequency baseline (> 0.7 Hz), the baseline corrected algorithm yields better classification results than non-corrected version (and other common factorization techniques). \n\n[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [CNT], [SMY], [GEN]]The objective function is defined with a Frobenius norm, which has an important influence on the obtained solutions, as it could be seen on Figure 2.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] The proposed method seems to provide a more discriminant factorization than the NMF one, at the expense of the sparsity of spatial and temporal components, impeding the biological interpretability. [[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] A possible solution is to add a regularization term to the objective function to ensure the sparsity of the factorization."[[MET-POS], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
