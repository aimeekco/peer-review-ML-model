"The paper takes a closer look at the analysis of SGD as variational inference, first proposed by Duvenaud et al. 2016\nand Mandt et al. 2016.[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In particular, the authors point out that in general, SGD behaves quite differently from Langevin diffusion due to the multivariate nature of the Gaussian noise.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  As the authors show based on the Fokker-Planck equation of the underlying stochastic process, there exists a conservative current (a gradient of an underlying potential) and a non-conservative current (which might induce stationary persistent currents at long times).[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The non-conservative part leads to the fact that the dynamics of SGD\tmay show oscillations, and these oscillations may even prevent the algorithm from converging to the 'right' local optima.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The theoretical analysis is carried-out very nicely, and the theory is supported by experiments on two-dimensional toy examples, and Fourier-spectra of the iterates of SGD.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThis is a nice paper which I would like to see accepted.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] In particular I appreciate that the authors stress the importance\nof 'non-equilibrium physics' for understanding the SGD process.[[MET-POS,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Also, the presentation is quite clear and the paper well written.[[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThere are a few minor points which I would like to ask the authors to address:\n\n1. Why cite Kingma and Welling as a source for variational inference in\tsection 3.1?[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] VI is a much older\tfield, and Kingma and Welling proposed a very special form of VI, namely amortized VI with inference networks.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] A better citation would be Jordan et\tal 1999.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n2. I'm not sure how much to trust the Fourier-spectra.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] In particular, perhaps the deviations from Brownian motion could also be due to the discrete\tnature of SGD (i.e. that the continuous-time formalism is only an approximation of a discrete process).[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]  Could you elaborate on this?[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\n3. Could you give the reader more details on how the uncertainty estimates on the Fourier transformations were obtained?\n\nThanks."[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]
