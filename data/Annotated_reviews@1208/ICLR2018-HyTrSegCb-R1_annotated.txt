"The paper is a pain to read.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Most of the citation styles are off (i.e., without parentheses).[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Most of the sentences are not grammatically correct.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Most, if not all, of the determiners are missing.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] It is ironic that the paper is proposing a model to generate grammatically correct sentences, while most of the sentences in the paper are not grammatically correct.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe experimental numbers look skeptical.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] For example, 1/3 of the training results are worse than the test results in Table 1.[[EXP-NEG,TNF-NEG,RES-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It also happens a few times in Table 5. [[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]Either the models are not properly trained, or the models are heavily tuned on the test set.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe running times in Table 9 are also skeptical.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Why are the Concorde models faster than unigrams and bigrams?[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Maybe this can be attributed to the difference in the size of the vocabulary, but why is the unigram model slower than the bigram model?"[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
