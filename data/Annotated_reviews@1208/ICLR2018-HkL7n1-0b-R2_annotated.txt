"This very well written paper covers the span between W-GAN and VAE.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-NEU], [APC], [MAJ]] For a reviewer who is not an expert in the domain, it reads very well, and would have been of tutorial quality if space had allowed for more detailed explanations.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The appendix are very useful, and tutorial paper material (especially A).[[BIB-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nWhile I am not sure description would be enough to reproduce and no code is provided, every aspect of the architecture, if not described, if referred as similar to some previous work.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] There are also some notation shortcuts (not explained) in the proof of theorems that can lead to initial confusion, but they turn out to be non-ambiguous.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] One that could be improved is P(P_X, P_G) where one loses the fact that the second random variable is Y.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n\nThis work contains plenty of novel material, which is clearly compared to previous work:\n- The main consequence of the use of Wasserstein distance is the surprisingly simple and useful Theorem 1.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS,SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I could not verify its novelty, but this seems to be a great contribution[[OAL-POS], [NOV-NEU], [APC], [MAJ]].\n- Blending GAN and auto-encoders has been tried in the past, but the authors claim better theoretical foundations that lead to solutions that do not rquire min-max[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [GEN]]\n- The use of MMD in the context of GANs has also been tried.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The authors claim that their use in the latent space makes it more practival[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe experiments are very convincing, both numerically and visually.[[EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSource of confusion: in algorithm 1 and 2, \\tilde{z} is \"sampled\" from Q_TH(Z|xi), some one is lead to believe that this is the sampling process as in VAEs, while in reality Q_TH(Z|xi) is deterministic in the experiments.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]"
