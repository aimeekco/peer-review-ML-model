"This is a nice paper.[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] It makes novel contributions to neural program synthesis by (a) using RL to tune neural program synthesizers such that they can generate a wider variety of correct programs and (b) using a syntax checker (or a learned approximation thereof) to prevent the synthesizer from outputting any syntactically-invalid programs, thus pruning the search space.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] In experiments, the proposed method synthesizes correct Karel programs (non-trivial programs involving loops and conditionals) more frequently than synthesizers trained using only maximum likelihood supervised training.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nI have a few minor questions and requests for clarification, but overall the paper presents strong results and, I believe, should be accepted.[[RES-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS,REC-POS], [APC,FBK], [MAJ]]\n\n\nSpecific comments/questions follow:\n\n\nFigure 2 is too small.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It would be much more helpful (and easier to read) if it were enlarged to take the full page width.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nPage 7: \"In the supervised setting...\" This suggests that the syntaxLSTM can be trained without supervision in the form of known valid programs, a possibility which might not have occurred to me without this little aside.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] If that is indeed the case, that's a surprising and interesting result that deserves having more attention called to it (I appreciated the analysis in the results section to this effect, but you could call attention to this sooner, here on page 7).[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nIs the \"Karel DSL\" in your experiments the full Karel language, or a subset designed for the paper?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nFor the versions of the model that use beam search, what beam width was used?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Do the results reported in e.g. Table 1 change as a function of beam width, and if so, how? \n"[[TNF-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
