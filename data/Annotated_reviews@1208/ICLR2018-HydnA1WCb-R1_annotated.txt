"This paper presents an interesting extension to Snell et al.'s prototypical networks, by introducing uncertainty through a parameterised estimation of covariance along side the image embeddings (means).[[INT-POS,RWK-POS,PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [SMY,APC], [MAJ]] Uncertainty may be particularly important in the few-shot learning case this paper examines, when it is helpful to extract more information from limited number of input samples.[[DAT-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nHowever, several important concepts in the paper are not well explained or motivated.[[CNT], [null], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, it is a bit misleading to use the word \"covariance\" throughout the paper, when the best model only employs a scalar estimate of the variance.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] A related, and potentially technical problem is in computing the prototype's mean and variance (section 3.3). Eq. 5 and 6 are not well motivated, and the claim of \"optimal\" under eq.6 is not explained.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] More importantly, eq. 5 and 6 do not use any covariance information (off-diagonal elements of S) --- as a result, the model is likely to ignore the covariance structure even when using full covariance estimate.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The distance function (eq. 4) is d Mahalanobis distance, instead of \"linear Euclidean distance\".[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] While the paper emphasises the importance of the form of loss function, the loss function used in the model is given without explanation (and using cross-entropy over distances looks hacky).[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nIn addition, the experiments are too limited to support the claimed benefits from encoding uncertainty.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Since the accuracies on omniglot data from recent models are already close to perfect, it is unclear whether the marginally improved number reported here is significant.[[DAT-NEG,RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In addition, more analysis may better support existing claims.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, showing subsampled images indeed had higher uncertainty, rather than only the histogram for all data points.[[DAT-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nPros:\n-Interesting problem and interesting direction.[[PDI-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n-Considers a number of possible alternative models[[MET-POS], [SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]\n-Intuitive illustration in Fig. 1[[TNF-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]\n\nCons:\n-Misleading use of \"covariance\"-The several important concepts including prototype mean/variance, distance, and loss are not well motivated or explained Evaluation is too limited"[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]
