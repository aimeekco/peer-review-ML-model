"+ Quality:\nThe paper discusses an interesting direction of incorporating humans in the training of a generative adversarial networks in the hope of improving generated samples.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I personally find this exciting/refreshing and will be useful in the future of machine learning.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nHowever, the paper shows only preliminary results in which the generator trained to maximize the PIR score (computed based on VGG features to simulate human aesthetics evaluation) indeed is able to do so.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] However, the paper lacks discussion / evidence of how hard it is to optimize for this VGG-based PIR score.[[EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] In addition, if this was challenging to optimize, it'd be useful to include lessons for how the authors manage to train their model successfully.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\nIn my opinion, this result is not too surprising given the existing power of deep learning to fit large datasets and generalize well to test sets.[[DAT-NEU,RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nAlso, it is not clear whether the GAN samples indeed are improved qualitatively (with the incorporation of the PIR objective score maximization objective) vs. when there is no PIR objective.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The paper also did not report sample quantitative measures e.g. Inception scores / MS-SSIM.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nI'd be interested in how their proposed VGG-based PIR actually correlates with human evaluation.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n+ Clarity: \n- Yosinski et al. 2014 citation should be Nguyen et al. 2015 instead (wrong author order / year).[[BIB-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- In the abstract, the authors should emphasize that the PIR model used in this paper is based on VGG features.[[ABS-NEU], [CNT], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n+ Originality: \n- The main direction of incorporating human feedback in the loop is original.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n+ Significance: \n- I think the paper contribution is lighter vs. ICLR standard.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Results are preliminary.[[RES-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall, I find this direction exciting and hope the authors would keep pushing in this direction! However, the current manuscript is not ready for publication."[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-POS,REC-NEG], [CRT,FBK], [MAJ]]
