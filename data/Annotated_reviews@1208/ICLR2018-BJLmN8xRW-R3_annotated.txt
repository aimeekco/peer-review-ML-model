"This paper proposes to automatically recognize domain names as malicious or benign by deep networks (convnets and RNNs) trained to directly classify the character sequence as such.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n\nPros\n\nThe paper addresses an important application of deep networks, comparing the performance of a variety of different types of model architectures.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe tested networks seem to perform reasonably well on the task.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n\nCons\n\nThere is little novelty in the proposed method/models -- the paper is primarily focused on comparing existing models on a new task.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe descriptions of the different architectures compared are overly verbose -- they are all simple standard convnet / RNN architectures.[[MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  The code specifying the models is also excessive for the main text -- it should be moved to an appendix or even left for a code release.[[MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe comparisons between various architectures are not very enlightening as they aren\u2019t done in a controlled way -- there are a large number of differences between any pair of models so it\u2019s hard to tell where the performance differences come from.[[MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It\u2019s also difficult to compare the learning curves among the different models (Fig 1) as they are in separate plots with differently scaled axes.[[TNF-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe proposed problem is an explicitly adversarial setting and adversarial examples are a well-known issue with deep networks and other models, but this issue is not addressed or analyzed in the paper.[[PDI-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] (In fact, the intro claims this is an advantage of not using hand-engineered features for malicious domain detection, seemingly ignoring the literature on adversarial examples for deep nets.) For example, in this case an attacker could start with a legitimate domain name and use black box adversarial attacks (or white box attacks, given access to the model weights) to derive a similar domain name that the models proposed here would classify as benign.[[INT-NEG,PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n\nWhile this paper addresses an important problem, in its current form the novelty and analysis are limited and the paper has some presentation issues."[[ANA-NEG,OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
