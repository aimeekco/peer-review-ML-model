"This paper proposed a NMT system that expands each sentence pair to two groups of similar sentences.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The idea of using similar sentence pairs as cluster-to-cluster translation is interesting.[[PDI-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] \nThe experimental results seem promising, but the presentation can be improved.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [PNF-NEU], [APC], [MAJ]] Some parts of the paper are hard to read.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n \n \nMajor\n1. What is the model/baseline in Tables 3, 4, 5?[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n2. What is the intuition in adding target cluster entropy in Eq. 3?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n3. In the adaptive cluster, I am a bit confused on the target of the parametric models. Where are X, Y of P(X|X*), P(Y|Y*) from?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT,QSN], [MAJ]] Is it from pretrained models? It wasn't clear until I read the algorithm. Also, why are p(X|X*) called target cluster and P(Y|Y*) called source cluster?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT,QSN], [MAJ]]\n4. In section 4.2, the name cluster is a bit confusing with the one in section 3.1. What's the relationship? The symbols C(Y*) and C(X*) are not used afterward.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n5. In the conclusion, it claims the system is efficient in helping current model. What do you mean by \"efficient\"?[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n6. The improvements of WMT are relatively small. Does it mean the proposed methods are not beneficial when there are large amounts of sentence pairs?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n7. What's the reward used in the experiments[[EXP-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MAJ]]?\n8. In the Monte-Carlo sampling, how many pairs are sampled? [[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n \nMinor \n1. In Table 1, where is sigma defined?[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n2. The notation D for a dataset in Section 3.3 is confusing with D in system D.[[DAT-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n3. There is some redundancy between Systems A, B, C, D and in the algorithm 1. I wonder whether it can be simplified.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n4. In section 4.3, backward NMT (X|Y) -> backward NMT P(X|Y).[[CNT], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n5. It will be great to show detailed derivation, for example from Eq. 9 to Eq. 10.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]\n6. Some recent results on WMT DE-EN are missing, such ashttps://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762.\n"[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEU], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]
