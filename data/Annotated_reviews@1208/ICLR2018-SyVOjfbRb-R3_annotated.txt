"The main contribution of this work is just a combination of LSH schemes and SGD updates.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Since hashing schemes essentially reduce the dimension, LSH brings computational benefits to the SGD operation.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] The targeted issue is fundamentally important, and the proposed approach (exploiting LSH schemes) seems to be sound.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  Specifically, LSH schemes fit into the SGD schemes since they hash two vectors to the same bucket with probability in proportional to their distance (here, inner product or Cosine similarity).[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nStrengths:  a sound approach; a simple and straightforward idea that is shown to work well in evaluations.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nWeaknesses: \n1. The phrase of \"computational chicken-and-egg loop\" in the title and also in the main body is misleading and not accurate.[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The so-called \"chicken-and-egg\u201d issue concerns the causality dilemma: two causally related things, which comes the first.[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In the paper, the authors concerned \"more accurate gradients\" and \"faster convergence\"; their causality is very clear (the first leads to the second), and there is no causality dilemma.[[INT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Even from a computational perspective, \"SDG schemes aim for computational efficiency\" and \"stochastic makes the convergence slow down\" are not a causality dilemma.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]]  The reason behind is that the latter is the cost of the first one, just the old saying that \"there is no such thing as a free lunch\".[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] Therefore, this disordered logic makes the title very misleading, and all the corresponding descriptions in the main body are obscured by \"twisted\" and unnatural logics.[[INT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n \n2. The depth is so limited.[[ANA-NEG,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Besides a good observation that LSH fits well into SDG, there are no more in-depth results provided.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] The theorems (Theorems 1~3) are trivial, with loose relations with LSH.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\t \n3. The LSH schemes are not correctly referred to.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Since the similarity metric is inner-product, the authors are expected to refer to Cosine similarity and inner-product based LSHs, which were published recently in NIPS.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] It is not in depth to assume \"any known LSH scheme\" in Alg. 2.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Accordingly again, Theorems 1~3 are unrelated with this specific kind of similarity metric (Cosine similarity).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n4. As the authors tried hard to stick to the unnecessary (a bit bragging) phrase \"computational chicken-and-egg loop\", the organization and presentation of the whole manuscript are poor.[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n5. Occasionally, there are typos, and it is not good to use words in formulas. Please proof-read carefully.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
