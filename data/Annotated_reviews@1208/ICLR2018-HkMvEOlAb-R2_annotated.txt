"This paper utilizes ACOL algorithm for unsupervised learning.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] ACOL can be considered a type of semi-supervised learning where the learner has access only to parent-class information (for example in digit recognition whether a digit is bigger than 5 or not) and not the sub-class information (number between 0-9)[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]. Given that in many applications such parent-class supervised information is not available[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]], the authors of this paper propose domain specific pseudo parent-class labels (for example transformed images of digits) to adapt ACOL for unsupervised learning[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]. The authors also modified affinity and balance term utilized in GAR (as part of ACOL algorithm) to improve it.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SUG], [GEN]] The authors use multiple data sets to study different aspects of the proposed approach[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]].\n\nI updated my scores based on the reviewers responses.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [CNT], [CNT]] It turned out that ACOL and GAR are also originally proposed by the same authors and was only published in arxiv![[RWK-POS,MET-POS,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] Because of the double-blind review nature of ICLR, I didn't know these ideas came from the same authors and is being published for the first time in a peer-reviewed venue (ICLR)[[EXT-NEG], [null], [FBK], [GEN]]. So my main problem with this paper, lack of novelty, is addressed and my score has changed.[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [DFT], [GEN]] Thanks to the reviewer for clarifying this.\n"[[EXT-NEU], [null], [FBK], [GEN,CNT]]
