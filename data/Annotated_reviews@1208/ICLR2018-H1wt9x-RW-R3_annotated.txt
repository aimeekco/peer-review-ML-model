"This paper looks at a specific aspect of the learning-to-teach problem, where the learner is assumed to have a teacher that selects training examples for the student according to a strategy.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The teacher's strategy should also be  learned from data.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]  In this case the authors look at finding interpretable teaching strategies.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The authors define the \"good\" strategies as similar to intuitive strategies (based on human intuition about the structure of the domain) or strategies that are effective for teaching humans.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  \nThe suggested method follow an iterative process in which the student and teacher are interchangeably used.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] At each iteration the teacher generates  examples based on the students current concept.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nI found it very difficult to follow the claims in the paper.[[PDI-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Why is it assumed that human intuition is necessarily good? [[PDI-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] The experiments do not answer these questions, but are designed to show that the suggested approach follows human intuition.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-POS,EXP-NEG], [null], [SUG], [GEN]] There are not enough details to get a good grasp of the suggested method and the different choices for it,  and similarly the experiments are not described in a very convincing way.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] Specifically - the domains picked seem very contrived,  there actual results are not reported, the size of the data seems minimal so it's not clear what is actually learned.[[PDI-NEG,RES-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]]\nHow would you analyze the teaching strategy in realistic cases, where there is no simple intuitive strategy? This would be more convincing."[[PDI-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]
