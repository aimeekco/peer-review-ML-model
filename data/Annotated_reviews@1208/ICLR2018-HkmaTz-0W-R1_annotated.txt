"This paper provides visualizations of different deep network loss surfaces using 2D contour plots, both at minima and along optimization trajectories.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] They mention some subtle details that must be taken into account, such as scaling the plot axes by the filter magnitudes, in order to obtain correctly scaled plots.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nOverall, I think there is potential with this work but it feels preliminary.[[OAL-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The visualizations are interesting and provide some general intuition, but they don't yield any clear novel insights that could be used in practice.[[EXP-POS], [NOV-NEG,EMP-POS], [SMY,APC,CRT], [GEN]] Also, several parts of the paper spend too much time on describing other work or on implementation details which could be moved to the appendix.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nGeneral Comments:\n- I think Sections 2, 3, 4 are too long, we only start getting to the results section at the end of page 4.[[RES-NEG,OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] I suggest shortening Section 2, and it should be possible to combine Sections 3 and 4 into a page at most.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SUG], [GEN]] 1D interpolations and 2D contour plots can be described in a few sentences each.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  \n- I think Section 5 can be put in the Appendix - it's essentially an illustration of why the weight scaling is important. [[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]Once these details are done correctly, the experiments support the relatively well-accepted hypothesis that flat minima generalize better. [[EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- The plots in Section 6 are interesting, it would be nice if the authors had an explanation of why the loss surface changes the way it does when skip connections are added.[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n- In Section 7, it's less useful to spend time describing what happens when the visualization is done wrong (i.e. projecting along random directions rather than PCA vectors) -  this can be put in the Appendix.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]] I would suggest just including the visualizations of the optimization trajectories which are done correctly and focus on deriving interesting/useful conclusions from them.[[EXP-NEG,OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]] "
