"The paper introduces a method for learning graph representations (i.e., vector representations for graphs).[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] An existing node embedding method is used to learn vector representations for the nodes[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. The node embeddings are then projected into a 2-dimensional space by PCA.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The 2-dimensional space is binned using an imposed grid structure.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The value for a bin is the (normalized) number of nodes falling into the corresponding region.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \n\nThe idea is simple and easily explained in a few minutes[[PDI-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. That is an advantage.[[INT-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Also, the experimental results look quite promising[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS], [SUB-POS,IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. It seems that the methods outperforms existing methods for learning graph representations[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. \n\nThe problem with the approach is that it is very ad-ho[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]c. There are several (existing) ideas of how to combine node representations into a representation for the entire graph[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. For instance, averaging the node embeddings is something that has shown promising results in previous work[[RWK-POS,RES-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. Since the methods is so ad-hoc (node2vec -> PCA -> discretized density map -> CNN architecure) and since a theoretical understanding of why the approach works is missing[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]], it is especially important to compare your method more thoroughly to simpler methods.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Again, pooling operations (average, max, etc.) on the learned node2vec embeddings are examples of simpler alternatives. [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe experimental results are also not explained thoroughly enough.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] For instance, since two runs of node2vec will give you highly varying embeddings (depending on the initialization)[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]], you will have to run node2vec several times to reduce the variance of your resulting discretized density maps.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] How many times did you run node2vec on each graph? \n[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]\n"
