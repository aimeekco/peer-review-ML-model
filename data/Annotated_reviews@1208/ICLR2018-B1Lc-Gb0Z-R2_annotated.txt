"This paper examines the problem of optimizing deep networks of hard-threshold units.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This is a significant topic with implications for quantization for computational efficiency, as well as for exploring the space of learning algorithms for deep networks.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] While none of the contributions are especially novel,[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] the analysis is clear and well-organized, and the authors do a nice job in connecting their analysis to other work.
