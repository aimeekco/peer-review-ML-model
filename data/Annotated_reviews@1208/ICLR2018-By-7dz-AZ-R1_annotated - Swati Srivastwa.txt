"****\nI acknowledge the author's comments and improve my score to 7.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n****\n\nSummary:\nThe authors propose an experimental framework and metrics for the quantitative evaluation of disentangling representations.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe basic idea is to use datasets with known factors of variation, z, and measure how well in an information theoretical sense these are recovered by a representation trained on a dataset yielding a latent code c.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe authors propose measures disentanglement, informativeness and completeness to evaluate the latent code c, mostly through learned nonlinear mappings between z and c measuring the statistical relatedness of these variables.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe paper ultimately is light on comprehensive evaluation of popular models on a variety of datasets and as such does not quite yield the insights it could.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nSignificance:\nThe proposed methodology is relevant, because disentangling representations are an active field of research and currently are not evaluated in a standardized way.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is lucidly written and very understandable.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nQuality:\nThe authors use formal concepts from information theory to underpin their basic idea of recovering latent factors and have spent a commendable amount of effort on clarifying different aspects on why these three measures are relevant.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nA few comments:\n1. How do the authors propose to deal with multimodal true latent factors?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] What if multiple sets of z can generate the same observations and how does the evaluation of disentanglement fairly work if the underlying model cannot be uniquely recovered from the data?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n2. Scoring disentanglement against known sources of variation is sensible and studied well here, but how would the authors evaluate or propose to evaluate in datasets with unknown sources of variation?[[DAt-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n3. the actual sources of variation are interpretable and explicit measurable quantities here.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] However, oftentimes a source of variation can be a variable that is hard or impossible to express in a simple vector z (for instance the sentiment of a scene) even when these factors are known.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] How do the authors propose to move past narrow definitions of factors of variation and handle more complex variables?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Arguably, disentangling is a step towards concept learning and concepts might be harder to formalize than the approach taken here where in the experiment the variables are well-behaved and relatively easy to quantify since they relate to image formation physics.\n4. For a paper introducing a formal experimental framework and metrics or evaluation I find that the paper is light on experiments and evaluation.[[EXP-POS,MET-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I would hope that at the very least a broad range of generative models and some recognition models are used to evaluate here, especially a variational autoencoder, beta-VAE and so on.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Furthermore the authors could consider applying their framework to other datasets and offering a benchmark experiment and code for the community to establish this as a means of evaluation to maximize the impact of a paper aimed at reproducibility and good science.[[DAt-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-POS], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nNovelty:\nPrevious papers like \"beta-VAE\" (Higgins et al. 2017) and \"Bayesian Representation Learning With Oracle Constraints\" by Karaletsos et al (ICLR 16) have followed similar experimental protocols inspired by the same underlying idea of recovering known latent factors, but have fallen short of proposing a formal framework like this paper does.[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It would be good to add a section gathering such attempts at evaluation previously made and trying to unify them under the proposed framework.\n"[[RWK-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]
