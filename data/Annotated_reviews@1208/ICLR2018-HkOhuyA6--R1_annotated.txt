"The authors propose to use 2D CNNs for graph classification by transforming graphs to an image-like representation from its node embedding.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The approach uses node2vec to obtain a node embedding, which is then compacted using PCA and turned into a stack of discretized histograms.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] Essentially the authors propose an approach to use a node embedding to achieve graph classification.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nIn my opinion there are several weak points:\n\n1) The approach to obtain the image-like representation is not well motivated[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]].ther approaches how to  aggregate the set of node embeddings for graph classification are known, see, e.g., \"Representation Learning on Graphs: Methods and Applications\", William L. Hamilton, Rex Ying, Jure Leskovec, 2017.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,BIB-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] The authors should compare to such methods as a baseline.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]\n\n2) The experimental evaluation is not convincing:\n- the selection of competing methods is not sufficient.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] I would like to suggest to add an approach similar to Duvenaud et al., \"Convolutional networks on graphs for learning molecular fingerprints\", NIPS 2015.\[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEU,EXT-NEU], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]n- the accuracy results are taken from other publications and it is not clear that this is an authoritative comparison;[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG,BIB-NEG], [CLA-NEG,CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] the accuracy results published for state-of-the-art graph kernels are superior to those obtained by the proposed method, cf., e.g., Kriege et al., [[RWK-POS,PDI-POS,MET-POS,BIB-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ,GEN]]\"On Valid Optimal Assignment Kernels and Applications to Graph Classification\", NIPS 2016.\[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]n- it would be interesting to apply the approach to graphs with discrete and continuous labels[[RWK-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS,REC-POS], [APC], [MAJ]].\n\n3) The authors argue that their method is preferable to graph kernels in terms of time complexity.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] This argument is questionable.[[PDI-NEG], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] Most graph kernels compute explicit feature maps and can therefore be used with efficient linear SVMs (unfortunately most publications use a kernelized SVM)[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. Moreover, the running of computing the node embedding must be emphasized: On page 2 the authors claim a \"constant time complexity at the instance level\"[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]], which is not true when also considering the running time of node2vec.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]] Moreover, I do not think that node2vec is more efficient than, e.g., Weisfeiler-Lehman refinement used by graph kernels.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]]\n\nIn summary: Since the technical contribution is limited, the approach needs to be justified by an authoritative experimental comparison[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [SMY,DFT], [MIN]]. This is not yet achieved with the results presented in the submitted paper. [[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]Therefore, it should not be accepted in its current form."[[INT-NEG,RWK-NEG], [NOV-NEG,REC-NEG], [DFT,FBK], [MIN]]
