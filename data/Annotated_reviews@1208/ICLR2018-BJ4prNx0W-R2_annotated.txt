"In this paper, the authors consider the problem of generating a training data set for the neural programmer-interpreter from an executable oracle.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In particular, they aim at generating a complete set that fully specifies the behavior of the oracle.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors propose a technique that achieves this aim by borrowing ideas from programming language and abstract interpretation.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The technique systematically interacts with the oracle using observations, which are abstractions of environment states, and it is guaranteed to produce a data set that completely specifies the oracle.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] The authors later describes how to improve this technique by further equating certain observations and exploring only one in each equivalence class.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Their experiments show that this improve technique can produce complete training sets for three programs.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nIt is nice to see the application of ideas from different areas for learning-related questions.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, there is one thing that bothers me again and again. Why do we need a data-generation technique in the paper at all?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] Typically, we are given a set of data, not an oracle that can generate such data, and our task is to learn something from the data.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] If we have an executable oracle, it is now clear to me why we want to replicate this oracle by an instance of the neural programmer-interpreter.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] One thing that I can see is that the technique in the paper can be used when we do research on the neural programmer-interpreter.[[MET-POS,FWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] During research, we have multiple executable oracles and need to produce good training data from them.[[DAT-NEU,EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The authors' technique may let us do this data-generation easily.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] But this benefit to the researchers does not seem to be strong enough for the acceptance at ICLR'18.\n\n "[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG], [CRT,FBK], [MAJ]]
