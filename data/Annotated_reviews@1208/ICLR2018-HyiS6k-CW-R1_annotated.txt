"OVERVIEW: The authors present results from several state-of-the-art generative models trained on a facial dataset for learning a general facial identity space.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nSTRENGTHS: The paper in general is well written and easy to ready. I appreciate the idea of the Turing test and qualitative results presented are quite impressive. Also, the use of  diverse state-of-the-art generative models is also a strong point.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  \n\nWEAKNESSES: While the strengths mentioned above are obvious I had the impression through the whole paper that a whole part is missing.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] My list of concerns are the following: \n\n    The authors state as their first contribution the presentation of a novel dataset.[[DAT-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] This is nice[[DAT-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [APC], [MIN]] but I see the data is actually already available as the photographic work of an artist.[[DAT-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] So what's the authors' contribution?[[DAT-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [QSN], [GEN]] As I understand from the paper it is just compiling this already available data.[[DAT-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n    The major problem of this paper in my opinion is the total lack of technical details.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In this sense the results cannot by any means by reproduced.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] While the authors use a set of very novel generative models[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] there is absolutely no detail on how do they train them.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] We are just shown some very impressive qualitative results which are indeed admirable but without further details I cannot judge them as true or not.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I strongly recommend to the authors, to provide technical details of topologies used, hyper parameters and any other important detail that would help a third party research to reproduce these results.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] \n    Also it is really hard to understand how could they obtain such impressive result by doing an unsupervised training on a dataset containing 3353 samples taking into account the high capacity of the models they are using.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n    In section 2.1 the authors mention that facial landmarks have been detected using a 'pre-trained ensemble-of-regresion-trees detector (Gerbrands, 1981)'.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] I know very well the facial alignment literature and I do not understand this reference.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] This I do not think is a reference to a facial alignment method bu t rather a set of general purpose linear algebra methods.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nTaking into account this major weaknesses I cannot accept this paper and I do not think it is worth discussing results and applications in Sections 3,4,5 before authors detail, explain and clarify how exactly they have obtained these results.
