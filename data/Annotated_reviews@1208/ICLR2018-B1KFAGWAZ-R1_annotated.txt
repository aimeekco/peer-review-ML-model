"This paper investigates multiagent reinforcement learning  making used of a \"master slave\" architecture (MSA).[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] On the positive side, the paper is mostly well-written, seems technically correct, and there are some results that indicate that the MSA is working quite well on relatively complex tasks.[[RES-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] On the negative side, there seems to be relatively limited novelty: we can think of MSA as one particular communication (i.e, star) configuration one could use is a multiagent system.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] One aspect does does strike me as novel is the \"gated composition module\", which allows differentiation of messages to other agents based on the receivers internal state.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] (So, the *interpretation* of the message is learned). I like this idea,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] however, the results are mixed, and the explanation given is plausible, but far from a clearly demonstrated answer.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThere are some important issues that need clarification:\n\n* \"Sukhbaatar et al. (2016) proposed the \u201cCommNet\u201d, where broadcasting communication channel among all agents were set up to share a global information which is the summation of all individual agents. [...] however the summed global signal is hand crafted information and does not facilitate an independently reasoning master agent.[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\"\n-Please explain what is meant here by 'hand crafted information', my understanding is that the f^i in figure 1 of that paper are learned modules?[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n-Please explain what would be the differences with CommNet with 1 extra agent that takes in the same information as your 'master'.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n\n*This relates also to this: \n\n\"Later we empirically verify that, even when the overall in-\nformation revealed does not increase per se, an independent master agent tend to absorb the same\ninformation within a big picture and effectively helps to make decision in a global manner.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Therefore\ncompared with pure in-between-agent communications, MS-MARL is more efficient in reasoning\nand planning once trained. [...] [[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\nSpecifically, we compare the performance among the CommNet model, our\nMS-MARL model without explicit master state (e.g. the occupancy map of controlled agents in this\ncase), and our full model with an explicit occupancy map as a state to the master agent.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] As shown in\nFigure 7 (a)(b), by only allowed an independently thinking master agent and communication among\nagents, our model already outperforms the plain CommNet model which only supports broadcast-\ning communication of the sum of the signals.[[MET-POS,TNF-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\"\n\n-Minor: I think that the statement \"which only supports broadcast-ing communication of the sum of the signals\" is not quite fair: surely they have used a 1-channel communication structure, but it would be easy to generalize that.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n-Major: When I look at figure 4D, I see that the proposed approach *also* only provides the master with the sum (or really mean) with of the individual messages...? So it is not quite clear to me what explains the difference.\n\n\n*In 4.4, it is not quite clear exactly how the figure of master and slave actions is created.[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This seems to suggest that the only thing that the master can communicate is action information?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] It this the case?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n* In table 2, it is not clear how significant these differences are.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] What are the standard errors?[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n* The section 3.2 explains standard things (policy gradient), but the details are a bit unclear.[[CNT], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] In particular, I do not see how the Gaussian/softmax layers are integrated; they do not seem to appear in figure 4?[[MET-NEG,TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n* I cannot understand figure 7 without more explanation.[[TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] (The background is all black - did something go wrong with the pdf?)[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n\n\n\nDetails:\n* references are wrongly formatted throughout.[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n* \"In this regard, we are among the first to combine both the centralized perspective and the decentralized perspective\"\nThis is a weak statement (E.g., I suppose that in the greater scheme of things all of us will be amongst the first people that have walked this earth...)[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n\n* \"Therefore they tend to work more like a commentator analyzing and criticizing the play, rather than\na coach coaching the game.[[OAL-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]]\"\n-This sounds somewhat vague.[[OAL-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]] Can it be made crisper?[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n* \"Note here that, although we explicitly input an occupancy map to the master agent, the actual infor-\nmation of the whole system remains the same.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\"\nThis is a somewhat peculiar statement.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Clearly, the distribution of information over the agents is crucial.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] For more insights on this one could refer to the literature on decentralized POMDPs.\n\n\n\n\n"[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
