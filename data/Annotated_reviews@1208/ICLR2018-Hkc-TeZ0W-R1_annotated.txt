"The paper seems clear enough and original enough.[[INT-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The idea of jointly forming groups of operations to colocate and figure out placement on devices seems to hold merit.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Where the paper falls short is motivating the problem setting. [[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]Traditionally, for determining optimal execution plans, one may resort to cost-based optimization (e.g., database management systems).[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] This paper's introduction provides precisely 1 statement to suggest that may not work for deep learning.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Here's the relevant phrase: \"the cost function is typically non-stationary due to the interactions between multiple devices\"[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. Unfortunately, this statement raises more questions than it answers[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [null], [DFT,QSN], [MIN]]. Why are the cost functions non-stationary?[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]] What exactly makes them dynamic?[[PDI-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] Are we talking about a multi-tenancy setting where multiple processes execute on the same device[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,QSN], [GEN]]? Unlikely, because GPUs are involved.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Without a proper motivation, its difficult to appreciate the methods devised.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG,FBK], [GEN]]\n\nPros:\n- Jointly optimizing forming of groups and placing these seems to have merit\[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]n- Experiments show improvements over placement by human \"experts[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\"\n- Targets an important problem\n\nCons:\n- Related work seems inadequately referenced[[RWK-POS,PDI-NEG,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY,SUG,FBK], [MIN]]. There exist other linear/tensor algebra engines/systems that perform such optimization including placing operations on devices in a distributed setting. [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]This paper should at least cite those papers and qualitatively compare against those approaches.[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Here's one reference (others should be easy to find): \"SystemML's Optimizer: Plan Generation for Large-Scale Machine Learning Programs\" by Boehm et al, IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, 2014.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- The methods are not well motivated. [[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]There are many approaches to devising optimal execution plans, e.g., rule-based, cost-based, learning-based.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] In particular, what makes cost-based optimization inapplicable?[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Also, please provide some reasoning behind your hypothesis which seems to be that while costs may be dynamic, optimally forming groups and placing them is learn-able.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- The template seems off[[TNF-NEG,OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. I don't see the usual two lines under the title (\"Anonymous authors\", \"Paper under double-blind review\").[[INT-NEG,RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- The title seems misleading. [[PDI-NEG], [APR-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\".... Device Placement\" seems to suggest that one is placing devices when in fact, the operators are being placed."[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]
