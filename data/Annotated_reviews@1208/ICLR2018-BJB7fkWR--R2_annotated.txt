"This paper introduces a method to learn a policy on visually different but otherwise identical games.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] While the idea would be interesting in general,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] unfortunately the experiment section is very much toy example so that it is hard to know the applicability of the proposed approach to any more reasonable scenario.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Any sort of remotely convincing experiment is left to 'future work'.[[EXP-NEG,FWK-NEU], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe experimental setup is 4x4 grid world with different basic shape or grey level rendering.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] I am quite convinced that any somewhat correctly setup vanilla deep RL algorithm would solve these sort of tasks/ ensemble of tasks almost instantly out of the box.[[MET-NEU,EXT-NEU], [CNT], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nFigure 5: Looks to me like the baseline is actually doing much better than the proposed methods?[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nFigure 6: Looking at those 2D PCAs, I am not sure any of those method really abstracts the rendering away.[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Anyway, it would be good to have a quantified metric on this, which is not just eyeballing PCA scatter plots."[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
