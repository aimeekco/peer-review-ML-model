"The paper proposed an extension to the fast weights from Ba et al. to include additional gating units for changing the fast weights learning rate adaptively.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors empirically demonstrated the gated fast weights outperforms other baseline methods on the associative retrieval task.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nComment:\n\n- I found the paper very hard to follow.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The authors could improve the clarity of the paper greatly by listing their contribution clearly for readers to digest.[[RWK-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The authors should emphasize the first half of the method section are from existing works and should go into a separate background section.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n- Overall, the only contribution of the paper seems to be the modification to Ba et al. is the Eq. (8).[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU,OAL-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors have only evaluated the method on a synthetic associative retrieval task.[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Without additional experiments on other datasets, it is hard for the reader to draw any meaningful conclusion about the proposed method in general.[[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]"
