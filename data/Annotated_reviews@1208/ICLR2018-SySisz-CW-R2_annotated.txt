"This work exploits the causality principle to quantify how the weights of successive layers adapt to each other.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  Some interesting results are obtained, such as \"enforcing more independence between successive layers of generators may lead to better performance and modularity of these architectures\" .[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Generally, the result is interesting and the presentation is easy to follow.[[RES-POS, OAL-POS], [EMP-POS,PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the proposed approach and the experiments are not convincible enough.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  For example,  it is hard to obtain the conclusion \"more independence lead to better performance\" from the experimental results.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Maybe more justifications are needed."[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]
