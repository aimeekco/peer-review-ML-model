"Thanks for all the explanations on my review and the other comments.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] While I can now clearly see the contributions of the paper, the minimal revisions in the paper do not make the contributions clear yet (in my opinion that should already be clear after having read the introduction).[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The new section \"intuitive analysis\" is very nice.[[ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n*******************************\n\nMy problem with this paper that all the theoretical contributions / the new approach refer to 2 arXiv papers, what's then left is an application of that approach to learning form imperfect demonstrations.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nQuality\n======\nThe approach seems sound[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but the paper does not provide many details on the underlying approach.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] The application to learning from (partially adversarial) demonstrations is a cool idea but effectively is a very straightforward application based on the insight that the approach can handle truly off-policy samples.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The experiments are OK [[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but I would have liked a more thorough analysis.[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nClarity\n=====\nThe paper reads well,[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  but it is not really clear what the claimed contribution is.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nOriginality\n=========\nThe application seems original.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSignificance\n==========\nHaving an RL approach that can benefit from truly off-policy samples is highly relevant.[[MET-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nPros and Cons\n============\n+ good results[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n+ interesting idea of using the algorithm for RLfD[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- weak experiments for an application paper[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- not clear what's new"[[EXP-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
