"Pros: \nThe paper is clearly written and studies an interesting problem.[[PDI-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \nThe transferrability of features described in Section 6 is interesting.[[CNT], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n\n1. The title \u201cassessing the generalization capability of CNNs\u201d is too broad, as the paper is only studying a narrow aspect of generalization.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n2. One of the conclusions of the paper is: \u201cAlthough CNNs do not intrinsically classify objects based on their shapes, they can learn to do so when trained with enough number of images with the same shape and different colors.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\u201d The conclusion is obvious when we train the network to make it invariant to colors and textures.[[EXP-NEU,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  If the emphasis of this conclusion is on  the number of images needed, then it will be good to show more analysis on Figure 6: e.g. Why does the accuracy curve drops to zero before going up?[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU,TNF-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG,QSN], [MIN]] Are the negative images messing up the training when the number is between 10^1 and 10^2?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n3. Negative images are fast to obtain, but they are oversimplified, and can be obtained via linear transform which is easy for neural networks.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Therefore it is not very convincing whether the conclusion applies to other types of data, e.g. train/test on RGB&Gray image pairs, which are more commonly seen.[[DAT-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Larger scale experiments on ImageNet is also recommended to show how general the conclusion of the paper is.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n4. The transferrability of features in Section 6 is an interesting problem to explore.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] It could provide more insights to practical problems if more experiments were done: e.g. can this technique help domain adaptation?\n\n"[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG,QSN], [MIN]]
