"The authors introduce a novel novel for collaborative filtering.[[INT-NEU], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The proposed model combines some of the strengths of factorization machines and of polynomial regression.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Another way to understand this model is that it's a feed forward neural network with a specific connection structure (i.e., not fully connected).[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is well written overall and relatively easy to understand.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The study seems fairly thorough (both vanilla and cold-start experiments are reported).[[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall the paper feels a little bit incomplete .[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] This is particularly apparent in the empirical study.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Given the somewhat limited novelty of the model the potential impact of this work relies on more convincing experimental results.[[RWK-NEU,RES-POS], [NOV-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] Here are some suggestions about how to achieve that: \n\n1) Methodically report results for MF, FM, CTR (when meaningful), other strong baselines (maybe SLIM?) and all your methods for all datasets.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]]\n\n2) Report results on well-known CF datasets.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] Movielens comes to mind.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n3) Shed some light on some of the poor CTR results (last paragraph of Section 4.2.2)\n\n4) Explore the models and shed some lights on where the gains are coming from.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n\nMinor: \n\n- How do you deal with unobserved preferences in the implicit case?\[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]n\n- I found the idea of Figure 1 very good but in its current form I didn't find it particularly insightful (these \"clouds\" are hard to interpret).[[PDI-NEG,TNF-POS], [EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]\n\n- It may also be worth adding this reference when discussing neural factorization:\nhttp://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mvolkovs/nips2017_deepcf.pdf\n"[[EXT-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]
