"The primary intellectual point the authors make is that previous networks for machine comprehension are not fully attentive.[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] That is, they do not provide attention on all possible layers on abstraction such as the word-level and the phrase-level[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]. The network proposed here, FusionHet, fixes problem.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Importantly, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance of the SQuAD dataset.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe paper is very well-written and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MIN]] I found the architecture very intuitively laid out, even though this is not my area of expertise.[[MET-POS], [PNF-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Moreover, I found the figures very helpful -- the authors clearly took a lot of time into clearly depicting their work![[TNF-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] What most impressed me, however, was the literature review.[[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Perhaps this is facilitated by the SQuAD leaderboard, which makes it simple to list related work.[[DAT-POS,RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Nevertheless, I am not used to seeing comparison to as many recent systems as are presented in Table 2.[[TNF-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nAll in all, it is difficult not to highly recommend an architecture that achieves state-of-the-art results on such a popular dataset."[[DAT-POS,RES-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]
