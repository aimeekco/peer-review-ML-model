"I very much appreciate the objectives of this paper:  learning compositional structures is critical for scaling and transfer.[[PDI-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]   \n\nThe first part of the paper offers a strategy for constructing a product MDP out of an original MDP and the automaton associated with an LTL formula, and reminds us that we can learn within that restricted MDP.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]   Some previous work is cited, but I would point the authors to much older work of Parr and Russell on HAMs (hierarchies of abstract machines) and later work by Andre and Russell, which did something very similar (though, indeed, not in hybrid domains).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]   The idea of extracting policies corresponding to individual automaton states and making them into options seems novel,[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  but it would be important to argue that those options are likely to be useful again under some task distribution.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  \n\nThe second part offers an exciting result:  If we learn policy pi_1 to satisfy objective phi_1 and policy pi_2 to satisfy objective phi_2, then it will be possible to switch between pi_1 and pi_2 in a way that satisfies phi_1 ^ phi_2.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]    This just doesn't make sense to me.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]   What if phi_1 is o ((A v B) Until C) and phi_2 is o ((not A v B) Until C).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]]    Let's assume that o(B Until C) is satisfiable, so the conjunction is satisfiable.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]   However, we may find policy pi_1 that makes A true and B false (in general, there is no single optimal policy) and find pi_2 that makes A false and B false, and it will not be possible to satisfy the phi_1 and phi_2 by switching between the policies.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]    But, perhaps I am misunderstanding something.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nSome other smaller points:\n- \"zero-shot skill composition\" sounds a lot like what used to be called \"planning\" or \"reasoning[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\"\n- The function rho is originally defined on whole trajectories but in eq 7 it is only on a single s':  I'm not sure exactly what that means.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- Section 4:  How is \"as soon as possible\" encoded in this objective?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- How does the fixed horizon interact with conjoining goals?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- There are many small errors in syntax;  it would be best to have this paper carefully proofread."[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]
