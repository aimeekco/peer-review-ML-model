"The paper is well written and clear[[INT-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. The main idea is to exploit a schema of semisupervised learning based on ACOL and GAR for an unsupervised learning task[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]. The idea is to introduce the notion of pseudo labelling.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \nPseudo labelling can be obtained by transformations of original input data[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [MIN,GEN]].\nThe key point is the definition of the transformations[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. \nOnly whether the design of transformation captures the latent representation of the input data, the pseudo-labelling might improve the performance of the unsupervised learning task[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]].\nSince it is not known in advance what might be a good set of transformations,[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SMY,DFT], [MIN]] it is not clear what is the behaviour of the model when the large portion of transformations are not encoding the latent representation of clusters."[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG,IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
