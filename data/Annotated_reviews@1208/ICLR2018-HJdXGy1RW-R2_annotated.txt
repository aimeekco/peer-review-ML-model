"This paper proposes a new convolutional network architecture, which is tested on three image classification tasks.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nPros:\nThe network is very clean and easy to implement, and the results are OK.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\nThe idea is rather incremental compared to FractalNet.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The results seem to be worse than existing networks, e.g., DenseNet (Note that SVHN is no longer a good benchmark dataset for evaluating state-of-the-art CNNs).[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Not much insights were given.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nOne additional question: Skip connections have been shown to be very useful in ConvNets.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Why not adopt it in CrescendoNet? [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]What's the point of designing a network without skip connections?\n"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
