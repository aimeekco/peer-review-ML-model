"The paper reformulates the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) in terms of inference for parameters of a prior distribution in a hierarchical Bayesian model. [[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]This provides an interesting and, as far as I can tell, novel view on MAML.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MIN]] The paper uses this view to improve the MAML algorithm.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The writing of the paper is excellent.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Experimental evalution is well done against a number of recently developed alternative methods in favor of the presented method,[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] except for TCML which has been exluded using a not so convincing argument.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The overview of the literature is also very well done.
