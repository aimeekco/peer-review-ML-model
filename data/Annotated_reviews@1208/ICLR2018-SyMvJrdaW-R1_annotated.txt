"Motivated via Talor approximation of the Residual network on a local minima, this paper proposed a warp operator that can replace a block of a consecutive number of residual layers.[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] While having the same number of parameters as the original residual network, the new operator has the property that the computation can be parallelized.[[RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] As demonstrated in the paper, this improves the training time with multi-GPU parallelization, while maintaining similar performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOne thing that is currently not very clear to me is about the rotational symmetry.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The paper mentioned rotated filters, but continue to talk about the rotation in the sense of an orthogonal matrix applying to the weight matrix of a convolution layer.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  The rotation of the filters (as 2D images or images with depth) seem to be quite different from \"rotating\" a general N-dim vectors in an abstract Euclidean space.[[MET-NEG, RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  It would be helpful to make the description here more explicit and clear."[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
