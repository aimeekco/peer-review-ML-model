"This paper proposes an improvement in the speed of training/inference with structured prediction energy networks (SPENs) by replacing the inner optimization loop with a network trained to predict its outputs.[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSPENs are an energy-based structured prediction method, where the final prediction is obtained by optimizing min_y E_theta(f_phi(x), y), i.e., finding the label set y with the least energy, as computed by the energy function E(), using a set of computed features f_phi(x) which comes from a neural network.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The key innovation in SPENs was representing the energy function E() as an arbitrary neural network which takes the features f(x) and candidate labels y and outputs a value for the energy.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] At inference time y can be optimized by gradient descent steps.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] SPENs are trained using maximum-margin loss functions, so the final optimization problem is max -loss(y, y') where y' = argmin_y E(f(x), y).[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe key idea of this paper is to replace the minimization of the energy function min_y E(f(x), y) with a neural network which is trained to predict the resulting output of this minimization. [[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]The resulting formulation is a min-max problem at training time with a striking similarity to the GAN min-max problem, where the y-predicting network learns to predict labels with low energy (according to the E-computing network) and high loss while the energy network learns to assign a high energy to predicted labels which have a higher loss than true labels (i.e. the y-predicting network acts as a generator and the E-predicting network acts as a discriminator).\n\nThe paper explores multiple loss functions and techniques to train these models.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They seem rather finnicky, and the experimental results aren't particularly strong when it comes to improving the quality over SPENs but they have essentially the same test-time complexity as simple feedforward models while having accuracy comparable to full inference-requiring energy-based models.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-POS,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The improved understanding of SPENs and potential for further work justify accepting this paper.[[OAL-NEU], [IMP-POS,REC-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]"
