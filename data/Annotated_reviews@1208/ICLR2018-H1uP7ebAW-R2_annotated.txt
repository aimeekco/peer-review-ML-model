"This paper presents an impressive set of results on predicting lung pathologies from chest x-ray images.[[INT-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \nAuthors present two architectures: one based on denseNet, and one based on denseNet + LSTM on output dimensions (i.e. similar to NADE model), and compare it to state of the art on the chest x-ray classification.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experiments are clearly described and results are significantly better compared to state of the art.[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,RES-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe only issue with this paper is, that their proposed method, in practice is not tractable for inference on estimating probability of a single output, a task which would be critical in medical domain.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Considering that their paper is titled as a work to use \"dependencies\" among labels, not being able to evaluate their network's, and lack of interpretable evaluation results on this model in the experiment section is a major limitation.[[INT-NEG,EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nOn the other hand, there are many alternative models where one could simply use multi-task learning and shared parameter, to predict multiple outcomes extremely efficiently.[[MET-NEU,EXT-NEU], [null], [SUG,DIS], [GEN]] To be able to claim that this paper improved the prediction by better modeling of 'dependencies' among labels, I would need to see how the (much simpler) multi-task setting works as well.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nThat said, the paper has several positive aspects in all areas:\n\nOriginality - the paper presents first combination of DenseNets with LSTM-based output factorization,[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nWriting clarity - the paper is very well written and clear.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nQuality - (apart from the missing multi-task baseline), the results are significantly better than state of the art, and experiments are well done,[[RWK-NEU,EXP-POS,RES-POS], [SUB-NEU,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nSignificance - Apart from the issue of intractable inference which is arguably a large limitation of this work,[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] the application in medical field is significant. \n\n"
