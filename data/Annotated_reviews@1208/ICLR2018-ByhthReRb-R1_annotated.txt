"The paper proposes to generate embedding of named-entities on the fly during dialogue sessions.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] If the text is from the user, a named entity recognizer is used.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] If it is from the bot response, then it is known which words are named entities therefore embedding can be constructed directly.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The idea has some novelty and the results on several tasks attempting to prove its effectiveness against systems that handle named entities in a static way.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOne thing I hope the author could provide more clarification is the use of NER.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] For example, the experimental result on structured QA task (section 3.1), where it states that the performance different between models of With-NE-Table and W/O-NE-Table is positioned on the OOV NEs not present in the training subset.[[RES-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MAJ]] To my understanding, because of the presence of the NER in the With-NE-Table model, you could directly do update to the NE embeddings and query from the DB using a combination of embedding and the NE words (as the paper does), whereas the W/O-NE-Table model cannot because of lack of the NER.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] This seems to prove that an NER is useful for tasks where DB queries are needed, rather than that the dynamic NE-Table construction is useful.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] You could use an NER for W/O-NE-Table and update the NE embeddings, and it should be as good as With-NE-Table model (and fairer to compare with too).[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nThat said, overall the paper is a nice contribution to dialogue and QA system research by pointing out a simple way of handling named entities by dynamically updating their embeddings.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It would be better if the paper could point out the importance of NER for user utterances, and the fact that using the knowledge of which words are NEs in dialogue models could help in tasks where DB queries are necessary.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]"
