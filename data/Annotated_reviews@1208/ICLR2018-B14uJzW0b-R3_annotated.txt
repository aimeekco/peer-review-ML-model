"This paper considers a special deep learning model and shows that in expectation, there is only one unique local minimizer.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] As a result, a gradient descent algorithm converges to the unique solution.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] This works address a conjecture proposed by Tian (2017).[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nWhile it is clearly written, my main concern is whether this model is significant enough.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The assumptions K=2 and v1=v2=1 reduces the difficulty of the analysis,[[ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but it makes the model considerably simpler than any practical setting.\n\n"[[OAL-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
