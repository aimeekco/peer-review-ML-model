"The authors of this paper propose some extensions to the Dynamic Coattention Networks models presented last year at ICLR.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] First they modify the architecture of the answer selection model by adding an extra coattention layer to improve the capture of dependencies between question and answer descriptions.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The other main modification is to train their DCN+ model using both cross entropy loss and F1 score (using RL supervision) in order to  reward the system for making partial matching predictions.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Empirical evaluations conducted on the SQuAD dataset indicates that this architecture achieves an improvement of at least 3%, both on F1 and exact match accuracy, over other comparable systems.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [GEN]] An ablation study clearly shows the contribution of the deep coattention mechanism and mixed objective training on the model performance.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper is well written, ideas are presented clearly and the experiments section provide interesting insights such as the impact of RL on system training or the capability of the model to handle long questions and/or answers.[[EXP-POS], [CLA-POS,IMP-POS,PNF-POS], [APC], [GEN]] It seems to me that this paper is a significant contribution to the field of question answering systems.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]] \n"
