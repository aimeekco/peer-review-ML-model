"The authors test a CNN on images with color channels modified (such that the values of the three channels, after modification, are invariant to permutations).[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe main positive point is that the performance does not degrade too much.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, there are several important negative points which should prevent this work, as it is, from being published.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEU], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n1. Why is this type of color channel modification relevant for real life vision?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] The invariance introduced here does not seem to be related to any real world phenomenon. [[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]The nets, in principle, could learn to recognize objects based on shape only, and the shape remains stable when the color channels are changed.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n2. Why is the crash car dataset used in this scenario?[[DAT-NEU], [IMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] It is not clear to me why this types of theoretical invariance is tested on such as specific dataset.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MAJ]] Is there a real reason for that?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n3. The writing could be significantly improved, both at the grammatical level and the level of high level organization and presentation.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MAJ]] I think the authors should spend time on better motivating the choice of invariance used, as well as on testing with different (potentially new) architectures, color change cases, and datasets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n4. There is no theoretical novelty and the empirical one seems to be very limited, with less convincing results."[[RES-NEG,OAL-NEU], [NOV-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
