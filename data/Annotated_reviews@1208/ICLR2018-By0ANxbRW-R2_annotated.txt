"The paper addresses an interesting problem of DNN model compression.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The main idea is to combine the approaches in (Han et al., 2015) and (Ullrich et al., 2017) to get a loss value constrained k-means encoding method for network compression.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU,BIB-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] An iterative algorithm is developed for model optimization.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN are reported to show the compression performance.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe reviewer would expect papers submitted for review to be of publishable quality.[[OAL-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]] However, this manuscript is not polished enough for publication: it has too many language errors and imprecisions which make the paper hard to follow.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In particular, there is no clear definition of problem formulation, and the algorithms are poorly presented and elaborated in the context.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nPros: \n\n- The network compression problem is of general interest to ICLR audience.[[PDI-POS], [APR-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nCons:\n\n- The proposed approach follows largely the existing work and thus its technical novelty is weak. [[RWK-NEU], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n- Paper presentation quality is clearly below the standard.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n- Empirical results do not clearly show the advantage of the proposed method over state-of-the-arts.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n\n\n"
