"\nThe authors present a study that aims at inferring the \"emotional\" tags provided by Thumblr users starting from images and texts in the captions.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] For text processing the authors use a standard LSTM taking as input GLOVE vectors of words in a sentence.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] For visual information, authors use a pretrained CNN (with fine tuning).[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A fully connected layer is used to fuse the multimodal information.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experimental results are reported in a self generated data set.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe contribution from the RL perspective is limited, in the sense that the authors simply applied standard models to predict a bunch of labels (in this case, emotion labels).[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] It is interesting the \"psychological\" analysis that the authors present in Section 6.[[ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Still, I think the contribution in that part is a: sentiment-psychologically inspired analysis of the Thumbrl data set.[[DAT-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nI think the author's statement on that this study leads to a more plausible psychological model of emotion is not well founded (they also mention to learn to recognize the latent emotional state).[[RES-NEG,OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Whereas it is true that psychological studies rely on self - filled questionnaires, comparing a questionnaire (produced by expert psychologist) to the tags provided by users in a social network is to ambitious. (in some parts the authors make explicit this is an approximation, this should be stressed in every part of the paper)\n"[[OAL-NEG], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]
