"The main insight in this paper is that LSTMs can be viewed as producing a sort of sketch of tensor representations of n-grams.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  This allows the authors to design a matrix that maps bag-of-n-gram embeddings into the LSTM embeddings.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  They then show that the result matrix satisfies a restricted isometry condition.[[RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]   Combining these results allows them to argue that the classification performance based on LSTM embeddings is comparable to that based on bag-of-n-gram embeddings.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nI didn't check all the proof details, but based on my knowledge of compressed sensing theory, the results seem plausible.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  I think the paper is a nice contribution to the theoretical analysis of LSTM word embeddings."[[MET-POS,ANA-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
