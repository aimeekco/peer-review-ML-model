"The paper presents a novel representation of graphs as multi-channel image-like structures[[RWK-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. These structures are extrapolated  by \n1) mapping the graph nodes into an embedding using an algorithm like node2vec\n2) compressing the embedding space using pca\n3) and extracting 2D slices from the compressed space and computing 2D histograms per slice.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]\nhe resulting multi-channel image-like structures are then feed into vanilla 2D CNN.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]\n  \nThe papers is well written and clear, and proposes an interesting idea of representing graphs as multi-channel image-like structures[[INT-POS,PDI-POS,MET-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [DFT], [MAJ]]. Furthermore, the authors perform experiments with real graph datasets from the social science domain and a comparison with the SoA method both graph kernels and deep learning architectures.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] The proposed algorithm in 3 out of 5 datasets, two of theme with statistical significant."[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]
