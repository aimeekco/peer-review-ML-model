"This paper proposes to improve time complexity of factorization machine.[[INT-NEU,PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Unfortunately, the paper's claim that FM's time complexity is quadratic to feature size is wrong.[[PDI-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Specifically, the dot product can be computed as (which is linear to feature size)\n\n(\\sum x_i \\beta_i)^T (\\sum x_i \\beta_i) - \\sum_i x_i^2 beta_i^T beta_i[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe projection of feature group into one embedded space proposed in the paper can be viewed as another form of representing the same model when group equals one.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] When the number of feature groups do not equal one, they correspond to field aware factorization machine(FFM)"[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]
