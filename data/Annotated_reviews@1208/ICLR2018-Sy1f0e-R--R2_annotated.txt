"Thanks for an interesting paper.[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThe paper evaluates popular GAN evaluation metrics to better understand their properties.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The \"novelty\" of this paper is a bit hard to assess.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] However, I found their empirical evaluation and experimental observations to be very interesting.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] If the authors release their code as promised, the off-the-shelf tool would be a very valuable contribution to the GAN community.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nIn addition to existing metrics, it would be useful to add Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM).[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \n\nHave you considered approximations to Wasserstein distance? E.g. Danihelka et al proposed using an independent Wasserstein critic to evaluate GANs:[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS,QSN], [MIN]] \nComparison of Maximum Likelihood and GAN-based training of Real NVPs\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05263.pdf[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nHow sensitive are the results to hyperparameters?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] It would be interesting to see some sensitivity analysis as well as understand the correlations between different metrics for different hyperparameters (cf. Appendix G in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04987.pdf)[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nDo you think it would be useful to compare other generative models (e.g. VAEs) using these evaluation metrics?[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Some of the metrics don't capture perceptual similarity, but I'm curious to hear what you think. \n"[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
