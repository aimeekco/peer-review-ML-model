"In this paper, the authors present a computational framework for the active vision problem.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Motivating the study biologically, the authors explain how the control policy can be learned to reduce the entropy of the posterior belief, and present an application (MNIST digit classification) to substantiate their proposal.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nI am not convinced about the novelty and contribution of the work.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The active vision/sensing problem has been well studied and both the information theory and Bayes risk formulations have already been considered in previous works (see Najemnik and Geisler, 2005; Butko and Movellan, 2010; Ahmad and Yu, 2013).[[RWK-POS,BIB-POS], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is also rife with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors and needs a thorough revision. Examples: foveate inspection the data (abstract), may allow to (motivation), tu put it clear (motivation), on contrary to animals retina (footnote 1), minimize at most the current uncertainty (perception-driven control), center an keep (fovea-based implementation), degrade te recognition (outlook and perspective).[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The citations are in non-standard format (section 1.2: Kalman (1960)).[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nOverall, I think the paper considers an important problem but the contribution to the state of the art is minimal, and editing highly lacking.[[PDI-POS,MET-NEU], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n1.
