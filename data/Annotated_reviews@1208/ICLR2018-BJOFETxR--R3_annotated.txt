"This paper presents a novel application of machine learning using Graph NN's on ASTs to identify incorrect variable usage and predict variable names in context.[[INT-POS,PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It is evaluated on a corpus of 29M SLOC, which is a substantial strength of the paper.[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe paper is to be commended for the following aspects:\n1) Detailed description of GGNNs and their comparison to LSTMs[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n2) The inclusion of ablation studies to strengthen the analysis of the proposed technique[[MET-POS,ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n3) Validation on real-world software data[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n4) The performance of the technique is reasonable enough to actually be used.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nIn reviewing the paper the following questions come to mind:\n1) Is the false positive rate too high to be practical?[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  How should this be tuned so developers would want to use the tool?[[OAL-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n2) How does the approach generalize to other languages? (Presumably well, but something to consider for future work.)[[MET-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nDespite these questions, though, this paper is a nice addition to deep learning applications on software data and I believe it should be accepted.\n\n"[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]
