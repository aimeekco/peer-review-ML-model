"The paper proposes a set of benchmarks for molecular design, and compares different deep models against them. [[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]The main contributions of the paper are 19 molecular design benchmarks (with chembl-23 dataset), including two molecular design evaluation criterias and comparison of some deep models using these benchmarks.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] The paper does not seem to include any method development.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nThe paper suffers from a lack of focus[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. Several existing models are discussed to some length, while the benchmarks are introduced quite shortly.[[INT-NEG,RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The dataset is not very clearly defined: it seems that there are 1.2 million training instance, does this apply for all benchmarks?[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT,QSN], [MIN]] The paper's title also does not seem to fit: this feels like a survey paper, which is not reflected in the title[[INT-NEG,EXT-NEG,OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [DFT,FBK], [MIN]]. Biologically lots of important atoms are excluded from the dataset, for instance natrium, calcium and kalium[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. I don't see any reason to exlude these[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. What does \"biological activities on 11538 targets\" mean?[[PDI-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT,QSN], [MIN]] \n\nThe paper discussed molecular generation and reinforcement learning, but it is somewhat unclear how it relates to the proposed dataset since a standard training/test setting is used.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Are the test molecules somehow generated in a directed or undirected fashion?[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]] Shouldn't there also be experiments on comparing ways to generate suitable molecules, and how well they match the proposed criterion? [[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] There should be benchmarks for predicting molecular properties (standard regression), and for generating molecules with certain properties.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS], [NOV-POS,SUB-POS], [APC,FBK], [MAJ]] Currently it's unclear which type of problems are solved here.[[PDI-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nTable 1 lists 5 models, while fig 3 contains 7, why the discrepancy?[[RWK-NEG,TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] In table 1 the plotted runs seem to differ a lot from average results (e.g. -0.43 to 0.15, or 0.32 to 0.83). [[RES-NEU,TNF-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]Variances should be added, and preferably more than 3 initialisations used.[[PDI-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nOverall this is an interesting paper[[INT-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]], but does not have any methodological contribution, and there is also few insightful results about the compared methods, nor is there meaningful analysis of the problem domain of molecules either[[INT-NEG,RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG,ANA-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]].\n"
