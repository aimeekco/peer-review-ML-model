"This paper proposes a label embedding network method that learns label embeddings during the training process of deep networks.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \nPros: Good empirical results.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nCons:  There is not much technical contribution.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The proposed approach is neither well motivated, nor well presented/justified.  The presentation of the paper needs to be improved.[[PDI-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n1. Part of the motivation on page 1 does not make sense. In particular, for paragraph 3, if the classification task is just to separate A from B, then (1,0) separation should be better than (0.8, 0.2). [[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n2. Label embedding learning has been investigated in many previous works.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The authors however ignored all the existing works on this topic, but enforce label embedding vectors as similarities between labels in Section 2.1 without clear motivation and justification.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This assumption is not very natural \u2014 though label embeddings can capture semantic information and label correlations, it is unnecessary that label embedding matrix should be m xm and each entry should represent the similarity between a pair of labels.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  The paper needs to provide a clear rationale/justification for the assumptions made, while clarifying the difference (and reason) from the literature works.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] \n\n3. The proposed model is not well explained.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n(1) By using the objective in eq.(14), how to learn the embeddings E?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n(2) The authors state \u201cIn back propagation, the gradient from z2 is kept from propagating to h\u201d.  This makes the learning process quite arbitrary under the objective in eq.(14). [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n(3) The label embeddings are not directly used for the classification (H(y, z\u2019_1)), but rather as auxiliary part of the objective.  How to decide the test labels?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS,QSN], [MAJ]]\n"
