"This paper proposes a novel adaptive learning mechanism to improve results in ergodic cooperation games.[[INT-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The algorithm, tagged 'Consequentialist Conditional Cooperation', uses outcome-based accumulative rewards of different strategies established during prior training.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Its core benefit is its adaptiveness towards diverse opposing player strategies (e.g. selfish, prosocial, CCC) while maintaining maximum reward.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nWhile the contribution is explored in all its technical complexity, fundamentally this algorithm exploits policies for selfish and prosocial strategies to determine expected rewards in a training phase.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] During operation it then switches its strategy depending on a dynamically-calculated threshold reward value (considering variation in agent-specific policies, initial game states and stochasticity of rewards) relative to the total reward of the played game instance.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] The work is contrasted to tit-for-tat approaches that require complete observability and operate based on expected future rewards.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] In addition to the observability, approximate Markov TFT (amTFT) methods are more processing-intense, since they fall back on a game's Q-function, as opposed to learned policies, making CCC a lightweight alternative.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nComments:\n\nThe findings suggest the effectiveness of that approach. [[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]In all experiments CCC-based agents fare better than agents operating based on a specific strategy.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] While performing worse than the amTFT approach and only working well for larger number of iterations, the outcome-based evaluation shows benefits.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Specifically in the PPD game, the use of CCC produces interesting results; when paired with cooperate agents in the PPD game, CCC-based players produce higher overall reward than pairing cooperative players (see Figure 2, (d) & (e)).[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  This should be explained.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  To improve the understanding of the CCC-based operation, it would further be worthwhile to provide an additional graph that shows the action choices of CCC agents over time to clarify behavioural characteristics and convergence performance.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nHowever, when paired with non-cooperative players in the risky PPD game, CCC players lead to an improvement of pay-offs by around 50 percent (see Figure 2, (e)), compared to payoff received between non-cooperative players (-28.4 vs. -18, relative to -5 for defection).[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  This leads to the question: How much CCC perform compared to random policy selection?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]  Given its reduction of processing-intensive and need for larger number of iterations, how much worse is the random choice (no processing, independent of iterations)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]  This is would be worthwhile to appreciate the benefit of the proposed approach.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nAnother point relates to the fishing game.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The game is parameterized with the rewards of +1 and +3.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] What is the bases for these parameter choices?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] What would happen if the higher reward was +2, or more interestingly, if the game was extended to allow agents to fish medium-sized fish (+2), in addition to small and large fish.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Here it would be interesting to see how CCC fares (in all combinations with cooperators and defectors).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and explores the technical details of the presented approach.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The authors position the approach well within contemporary literature, both conceptually and using experimental evaluation, and are explicit about its strengths and limitations.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nPresentation aspects:\n- Minor typo: Page 2, last paragraph of Introduction: `... will act act identically.[[INT-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]'\n- Figure 2 should be shifted to the next page, since it is not self-explanatory and requires more context.\n"[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
