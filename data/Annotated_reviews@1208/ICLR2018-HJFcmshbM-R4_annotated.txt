"The paper describes a method for detecting adversarial examples using a second detector classifier.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The key innovation here is to use pixel saliency as a channel for the adversarial example detector.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Pixel saliency, in this case, is defined as the partial derivative of the output of the classification network with respect to each input pixel. [[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]Several examples are used to show that even visually similar adversarial examples can have very different saliency maps, which motivates using these saliency maps to detect adversaries.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The experiments show that this approach can be used to successfully detect adversaries for several datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and a small subset of ImageNet, and also investigates the robustness across different variations of attack.\[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]n\nIn general, I think the idea of using saliency to detect adversarial attacks is very good and represents an interesting avenue of research.[[MET-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the paper as it stands seems rather preliminary, and there are several issues with the paper I think need to be addressed.[[OAL-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n1) Sec 2.2 introduces the C&W attack.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] However, this does not appear to be used anywhere else in the paper.[[MET-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [MIN]] It is not clear from the paper why the authors do not test their systems resiliency to this form of attack.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] More advanced attacks need to be considered.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n2) I would have liked to have seen an ablative study where the detectors are trained on pixels alone and directly compared with the detectors trained with saliency as an input channel.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] This would give a much more convincing account of the value of saliency in this context.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]\n3) It is easy to envision a (full knowledge) attack where the attacker knows the architecture and parameters of the detector and then devises an attack to fool both the detector and the original classifier. [[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]This could, for example, be done by optimizing a joint objective which modifies the input to both maximize error in the classifier and in the detector simultaneously, while remaining close to the original input. [[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]Unfortunately, there is no investigation of this kind of attack in the paper. [[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]Of course, it is fine if the assumption is that the attacker has no knowledge of the detector (black box case), but if this is the case, this assumption needs to be explicitly acknowledged up front and attention drawn to the obvious limitations of this approach.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n4) There is no direct comparison with other state-of-the-art in the paper.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Related work is mentioned in 2.3, but a direct comparison in which the experimental settings are identical in the evaluation would have been helpful.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n5) The mathematical notation needs a bit of improvement. E.g. argmin, sgn, min, etc. should be set in roman and parentheses should be enlarged to match the size of the enclosed expressions.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]] There is also a bit of overloading going on: at the start of 2.1 it appears f_theta refers to the true function, then later the classification model, and then in eq (4) a linear approximation of the classification model.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n6) The writing needs improvement and the paper in general needs some copy editing.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]] There are quite a few grammatical errors and typos which, unfortunately, can make the text difficult to comprehend in parts.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Captions also run into the text in a few places.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
