"The key contribution of the paper is a new method for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe proposed method is (more or less) a modification of the DrLIM manifold learning algorithm (Hadsell, Chopra, LeCun 2006) with a slightly different loss function that is inspired by multidimensional scaling.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] While DrLIM only preserves local geometry, the modified loss function presents the opportunity to preserve both local and global geometry.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The rest of the paper is devoted to an empirical validation of the proposed method on small-scale synthetic data (the familiar Swiss roll, as well as a couple of synthetic image datasets).[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper revisits mostly familiar ideas.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The importance of preserving both local and global information in manifold learning is well known, so unclear what the main conceptual novelty is.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This reviewer does not believe that modifying the loss function of a well established previous method that is over 10 years old (DrLIM) constitutes a significant enough contribution.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nMoreover, in this reviewer's experience, the major challenge is to obtain proper estimates of the geodesic distances between far-away points on the manifold, and such an estimation is simply too difficult for any reasonable dataset encountered in practice.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] However, the authors do not address this, and instead simply use the Isomap approach for approximating geodesics by graph distances, which opens up a completely different set of challenges (how to construct the graph, how to deal with \"holes\" in the manifold, how to avoid short circuiting in the all-pairs shortest path computations etc etc).[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nFinally, the experimental results are somewhat uninspiring.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It seems that the proposed method does roughly as well as Landmark Isomap (with slightly better generalization properties) but is slower by a factor of 1000x.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nThe horizon articulation data, as well as the pose articulation data, are both far too synthetic to draw any practical conclusions. \n"[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
