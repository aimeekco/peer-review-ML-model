"The paper discusses the problems of meta optimization with small look-ahead: do small runs bias the results of tuning?[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The result is yes and the authors show how differently the tuning can be compared to tuning the full run.[[RES-POS], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The Greedy schedules are far inferior to hand-tuned schedules as they focus on optimizing the large eigenvalues while the small eigenvalues can not be \"seen\" with a small lookahead.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors show that this effect is caused by the noise in the obective function.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\npro:\n- Thorough discussion of the issue with theoretical understanding on small benchmark functions as well as theoretical work\n- Easy to read and follow[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\ncons:\n-Small issues in presentation: \n* Figure 2 \"optimal learning rate\" -> \"optimal greedy learning rate\", also reference to Theorem 2 for increased clarity.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n* The optimized learning rate in 2.3 is not described. This reduces reproducibility.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n* Figure 4 misses the red trajectories, also it would be easier to have colors on the same (log?)-scale. [[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n  The text unfortunately does not explain why the loss function looks so vastly different\n  with different look-ahead.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] I would assume from the description that the colors are based\n  on the final loss values obtaine dby choosing a fixed pair of decay exponent and effective LR.[[RES-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]] \n\nTypos and notation:\npage 7 last paragraph: \"We train the all\" -> We train all\nnotation page 5: i find \\nabla_{\\theta_i} confusing when \\theta_i is a scalar, i would propose \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_i}\npage 2: \"But this would come at the expense of long-term optimization process\": at this point of the paper it is not clear how or why this should happen.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Maybe add a sentence regarding the large/Small eigenvalues?"[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
