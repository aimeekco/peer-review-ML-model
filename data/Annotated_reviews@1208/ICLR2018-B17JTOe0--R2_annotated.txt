"Congratulations on a very interesting and clear paper.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  While ICLR is not focused on neuroscientific studies, this paper clearly belongs here as it shows what representations develop in recurrent networks that are trained on spatial navigation.[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] Interestingly, these include representations that have been observed in mammals and that have attracted considerable attention, even honored with a Nobel prize. [[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nI found it is very interesting that the emergence of these representations was contingent on some regularization constraint.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] This seems similar to the visual domain where edge detectors emerge easily when trained on natural images with sparseness constraints as in Olshausen&Field and later reproduced with many other models that incorporate sparseness constraints.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nI do have some questions about the training itself.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The paper mentions a metabolic cost that is not specified in the paper.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] This should be added.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] \n\nMy biggest concern is about Figure 6a.[[TNF-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]] I am puzzled why is the error is coming down before the boundary interaction?[[TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Even more puzzling, why does this error go up again for the blue curve (no interaction)? Shouldn\u2019t at least this curve be smooth?\n"[[TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
