"This paper proposes to use graph neural networks for the purpose of few-shot learning, as well as semi-supervised learning and active learning.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper first relies on convolutional neural networks to extract image features.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Then, these image features are organized in a fully connected graph.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Then, this graph is processed with an graph neural network framework that relies on modelling the differences between features maps, \\propto \\phi(abs(x_i-x_j)).[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  For few-shot classification then the cross-entropy classification loss is used on the node.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper has some interesting contributions and ideas, mainly from the point of view of applications, since the basic components (convnets, graph neural networks) are roughly similar to what is already proposed.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the novelty is hurt by the lack of clarity with respect to the model design.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nFirst, as explained in 5.1 a fully connected graph is used (although in Fig. 2 the graph nodes do not have connections to all other nodes).[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] If all nodes are connected to all nodes, what is the different of this model from a fully connected, multi-stream networks composed of S^2 branches?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] To rephrase, what is the benefit of having a graph structure when all nodes are connected with all nodes.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Besides, what is the effect when having more and more support images?[[TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is the generalization hurt?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nSecond, it is not clear whether the label used as input in eq. (4) is a model choice or a model requirement.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The reason is that the label already appears in the loss of the nodes  in 5.1. Isn't using the label also as input redundant?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThird, the paper is rather vague or imprecise at points.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  In eq. (1) many of the notations remain rather unclear until later in the text (and even then they are not entirely clear).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For instance, what is s, r, t.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\nThe experimental section is also ok, although not perfect.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  The proposed method appears to have a modest improvement for few-shot learning.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, in the case of  active learning and semi-supervised learning the method is not compared to any baselines (other than the random one), which makes conclusions hard to reach.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn general, I tend to be in favor of accepting the paper if the authors have persuasive answers and provide the clarifications required."[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MIN]]
