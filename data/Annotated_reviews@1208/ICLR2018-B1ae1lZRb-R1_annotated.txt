"The authors investigate knowledge distillation as a way to learn low precision networks.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They propose three training schemes to train a low precision student network from a teacher network.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They conduct experiments on ImageNet-1k with variants of ResNets and multiple low precision regimes and compare performance with previous works\n\n[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]Pros:\n(+) The paper is well written, the schemes are well explained\n(+) Ablations are thorough and comparisons are fair\n[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS,ANA-POS,OAL-NEU], [CLA-POS,CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]Cons:\n(-) The gap with full precision models is still large \n(-)[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Transferability of the learned low precision models to other tasks is not discussed\n\n[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]The authors tackle a very important problem, the one of learning low precision models without comprosiming performance.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] For scheme-A, the authors show the performance of the student network under many low precision regimes and different depths of teacher networks.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] One observation not discussed by the authors is that the performance of the student network under each low precision regime doesn't improve with deeper teacher networks (see Table 1, 2 & 3).[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,ANA-NEG,TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] As a matter of fact, under some scenarios performance even decreases.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nThe authors do not discuss the gains of their best low-precision regime in terms of computation and memory.[[RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nFinally, the true applications for models with a low memory footprint are not necessarily related to image classification models (e.g. ImageNet-1k).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] How good are the low-precision models trained by the authors at transferring to other tasks?[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is it possible to transfer student-teacher training practices to other tasks?"[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
