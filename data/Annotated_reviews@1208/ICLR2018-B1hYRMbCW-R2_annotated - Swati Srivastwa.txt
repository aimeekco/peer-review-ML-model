"This paper is proposing a new formulation for regularization of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial models (WGAN).[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The original min/max formulation of the WGAN aim at minimizing over all measures, the maximal dispersion of expectation for 1-Lipschitz with the one provided by the empirical measure.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This problem is often regularized by adding a \"gradient penalty\", \\ie a  penalty of the form \"\\lambda E_{z~\\tau}}(||\\grad f (z)||-1)^2\" where \\tau is the distribution of (tx+(1-x)y) where x is drawn according to the empirical measure and y is drawn according to the target measure.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] In this work the authors consider substituting the previous penalty by \"\\lambda E_{z~\\tau}}(max( ||\\grad f (z)||-1,0)^2\".[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nOverall the paper is too vague on the mathematical part, and the experiments provided are not particularly convincing in assessing the benefit of the new penalty.[[EXP-NEG,OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nThe authors have tried to use mathematical formulations to motivate their choice, but they lack rigorous definitions/developments to make their point convincing.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nThey should also present early their model and their mathematical motivation: in what sense is their new penalty \"preferable\"?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n\n\nPresentation issues:\n- in printed black and white versions most figures are meaningless.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- red and green should be avoided on the same plots, as colorblind people will not perceived any difference...[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- format for images should be vectorial (eps or pdf), not jpg or png...[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- legend/sizes are not readable (especially in printed version).[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nReferences issues:\n- harmonize citations: if you add first name for some authors add them for all of them: why writing Harold W.
