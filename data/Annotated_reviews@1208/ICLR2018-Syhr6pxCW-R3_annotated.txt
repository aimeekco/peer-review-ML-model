"This paper proposes a compositional nearest-neighbors approach to image synthesis, including results on several conditional image generation datasets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nPros:\n- Simple approach based on nearest-neighbors, likely easier to train compared to GANs.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- Scales to high-resolution images.[[TNF-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n- Requires a potentially costly search procedure to generate images.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- Seems to require relevant objects and textures to be present in the training set in order to succeed at any given conditional image generation task."[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
