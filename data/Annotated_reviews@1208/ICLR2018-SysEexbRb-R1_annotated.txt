"Authors of this paper provided full characterization of the analytical forms of the critical points for the square loss function of three types of neural networks: shallow linear networks, deep linear networks and shallow ReLU nonlinear networks.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The analytical forms of the critical points have direct implications on the values of the corresponding loss functions, achievement of global minimum, and various landscape properties around these critical points.[[DAT-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThe paper is well organized and well written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Authors exploited the analytical forms of the critical points to provide a new proof for characterizing the landscape around the critical points.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [GEN]] This technique generalizes existing work under full relaxation of assumptions.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] In the linear network with one hidden layer, it generalizes the work Baldi & Hornik (1989) with arbitrary network parameter dimensions and any data matrices;[[RWK-NEU, MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] In the deep linear networks, it generalizes the result in Kawaguchi (2016) under no assumptions on the network parameters and data matrices.[[RWK-NEU, MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Moreover, it also provides new characterization for shallow ReLU nonlinear networks, which is not discussed in previous work.[[RWK-NEU, MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThe results obtained from the analytical forms of the critical points are interesting,[[RES-POS,ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but one problem is that how to obtain the proper solution of equation (3)?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] In the Example 1, authors gave a concrete example to demonstrate both local minimum and local maximum do exist in the shallow ReLU nonlinear networks by properly choosing these matrices satisfying (12).[[CNT], [CNT], [DIS], [MIN]] It will be interesting to see how to choose these matrices for all the studied networks with some concrete examples."[[MET-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
