"Summary:\nThis paper proposes an approach to generate images which are more aesthetically pleasing, considering the feedback of users via user interaction.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] However, instead of user interaction, it models it by a simulated measure of the quality of user interaction and then feeds it to a Gan architecture.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nPros:\n+ The paper is well-written[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] and has just a few typos: 2.1: \u201can Gan\u201d.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n+ The idea is very interesting. [[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n\n- Page 2- section 2- The reasoning that a deep-RL could not be more successful is not supported by any references and it is not convincing.[[CNT], [CNT], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n- Page 3- para 3 - mathematically the statement does not sound since the 2 expressions are exactly equivalent.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] The slight improvement may be achieved only by chance and be due to computational inefficiency, or changing a seed.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  \n\n- Page 3- 2.2. Using a crowd-sourcing technique, developing a similarly small dataset (1000 images with 100 annotations) would normally cost less than 1k$.[[DAT-NEU], [CNT], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\n- Page 3- 2.2.It is highly motivating to use users feedback in the loop but it is poorly explained how actually the user's' feedback is involved if it is involved at all.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n- Page 4- sec 3 \".. it should be seen as a success\"; the claim is not supported well.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n- Page 4- sec 3.2- last paragraph.[[CNT], [CNT], [DIS], [GEN]]\nThis claim lacks scientific support, otherwise please cite proper references.[[MET-NEG], [CNT], [DFT], [MAJ]] The claim seems like a subjective understanding of conscious perception and unconscious perception of affective stimuli is totally disregarded.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nThe experimental setup is not convincing.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n- Page 4. 3.3) \"Note that.. outdoor images\" this is implicitly adding the designers' bias to the results.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The statement lacks scientific support.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n- Page 4. 3.3) the importance of texture and shape is disregarded.[[RES-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \u201cIn the Eye of the Beholder: Employing Statistical Analysis and Eye Tracking for Analyzing Abstract Paintings, Yanulevskaya et al\u201d\nThe architecture may lead in overfitting to users' feedback (being over-fit on the data with PIR measures)\n\n- Page 6-Sec 4.2)[[BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \" It had more difficulty optimizing for the three-color result\" why?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] please discuss it.\n\n- The expectation which is set in the abstract and the introduction of the paper is higher than the experiments shown in the Experimental setup.\n"[[ABS-NEG,INT-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [MAJ]]
