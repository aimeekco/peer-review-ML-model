"The authors propose the use of a gamma prior as the distribution over \nthe latent representation space in GANs. [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]The motivation behind it is that \nin GANs interpolating between sampled points is common in the process of generating examples but the use of a normal prior results in samples that fall in low probability mass regions.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [MIN]]The use of the proposed gamma distribution, as a simple alternative, overcomes this problem.[[RWK-POS,DAT-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS,ANA-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nIn general, the proposed work is very interesting and the idea is neat.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS,SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \nThe paper is well presented and I want to underline the importance of this.[[INT-POS], [SUB-POS,PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nThe authors did a very good job presenting the problem, motivation and solution in a coherent fashion and easy to follow.[[PDI-POS,OAL-POS], [REC-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThe work itself is interesting and can provide useful alternatives for the distribution over the latent space.[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,ANA-POS], [SUB-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n"
