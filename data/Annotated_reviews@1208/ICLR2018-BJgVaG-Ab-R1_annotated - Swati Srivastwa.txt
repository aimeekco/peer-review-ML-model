"The paper argues for structured task representations (in TLTL) and shows how these representations can be used to reuse learned subtasks to decrease learning time.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nOverall, the paper is sloppily put together, so it's a little difficult to assess the completeness of the ideas.[[PDI-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The problem being solved is not literally the problem of decreasing the amount of data needed to learn tasks, but a reformulation of the problem that makes it unnecessary to relearn subtasks.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] That's a good idea, but problem reformulation is always hard to justify without returning to a higher level of abstraction to justify that there's a deeper problem that remains unchanged.[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The paper doesn't do a great job of making that connection.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe idea of using task decomposition to create intrinsic rewards seems really interesting,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but does not appear to be explored in any depth.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Are there theorems to be had?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] Is there a connection to subtasks rewards in earlier HRL papers?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThe lack of completeness (definitions of tasks and robustness) also makes the paper less impactful than it could be.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG,SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n\"learn hierarchical policies\" -> \"learns hierarchical policies\"?[[CNT], [CLA-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n\"n games Mnih et al.
