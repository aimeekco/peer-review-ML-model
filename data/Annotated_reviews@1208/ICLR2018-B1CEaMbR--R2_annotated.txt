"In this paper the authors give a nice review of clustering methods with deep learning and a systematic taxonomy for existing methods.[[INT-POS,PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [SMY,APC], [GEN]] Finally, the authors propose a new method by using one unexplored combination of taxonomy features.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. The proposed combination is straightforward,[[MET-POS], [PNF-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] but lack of novelty.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] From table 1, it seems that the only differences between the proposed method and DEPICK is whether the method uses balanced assignment and pretraining.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,TNF-NEG], [CMP-NEG,PNF-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] I am not convinced that these changes will lead to a significant difference.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] The performance of the proposed method and DEPICK are also similar in table 1.[[MET-NEG,TNF-NEG], [NOV-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nIn addition, the experiments section is not comprehensive enough as well the author only tested on two datasets.[[EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG,DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT,DFT], [MIN]] More datasets should be tested for evaluation.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]] In addition, It seems that nearly all the experiments results from comparison methods are borrowed from the original publications.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The authors should finish the experiments on comparison methods and fill the entries in Table 1.\n\n[[EXP-NEG,TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]In summary, the proposed method is lack of novelty compare to existing methods.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The survey part is nice,[[ANA-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] however extensive experiments should be conducted by running existing methods on different datasets and analyzing the pros and cons of the methods and their application scenarios. [[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]Therefore, I think the paper cannot be accepted at this stage.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]
