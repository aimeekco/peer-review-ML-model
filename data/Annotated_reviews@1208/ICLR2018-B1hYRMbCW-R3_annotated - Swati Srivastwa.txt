"The article deals with regularization/penalization in the fitting of GANs, when based on a L_1 Wasserstein metric.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Basics on mass transportation are briefly recalled in section 2, while section 3 formulate the GANs approach in the Wasserstein context.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Taking into account the Lipschitz constraint and (non-) differentiability of optimal critic functions f are discussed in section 4 and Section 5 proposes a way to penalize candidate functions f that do not satisfy the Lipschitz condition using a tuning parameter lambda, ruling a trade-off between marginal fitting and gradient control.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The approach is illustrated by numerical experiments.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Such results are hardly convincing, since the tuning of the parameter lambda plays a crucial role in the performance of the method.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] More importantly, The heuristic proposed in the paper is interesting and promising in some respects[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but there is a real lack of theoretical guarantees motivating the penalty form chosen, such a theoretical development could allow to understand what may rule the choice of an ideal value for lambda in particular."[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]
