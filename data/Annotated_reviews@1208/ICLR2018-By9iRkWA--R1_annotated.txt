"This paper introduces a fairly elaborate model for reading comprehension evaluated on the SQuAD dataset. [[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The model is shown to improve on the published results but not as-of-submission leaderboard numbers.[[RWK-NEU,RES-POS], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe main weakness of the paper in my opinion is that the innovations seem to be incremental and not based on any overarching insight or general principle.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MAJ]]  A less significant issue is that the English is often disfluent.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nSpecific comments: I would remove the significance daggers from table 2 as the standard deviations are already reported and the null hypothesis for which significance is measured seems unclear.[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [IMP-NEG,PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]  I am also concerned to see test performance significantly better than development performance in table 3.[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]  Other systems seem to have development and test performance closer together. [[RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] Have the authors been evaluating many times on the test data?[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n"
