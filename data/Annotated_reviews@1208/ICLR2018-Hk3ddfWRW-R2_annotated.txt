"The authors provide a method for learning from demonstrations where several modalities of the same task are given.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors argue that in the case where several demonstrations exists and a deterministic (i.e., regular network) is given, the network learns some average policy from the demonstrations.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper begins with the authors stating the motivation and problem of how to program robots to do a task based only on demonstrations rather on explicit modeling or programming.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] They put the this specific work in the right context of imitation learning and IRL.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Afterward, the authors argue that deterministic network cannot adequately several modalities.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The authors cover in Section 2 related topics, and indeed the relevant literature includes behavioral cloning, IRL , Imitation learning, GAIL, and VAEs.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] I find that recent paper by Tamar et al 2016.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] on Value Iteration Networks is highly relevant to this work: the authors there learn similar tasks (i.e., similar modalities) using the same network.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Even the control task is very similar to the current proposed task in this paper.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe authors argue that their contribution is 3-fold: (1) does not require robot  rollouts, (2) does not require label for a task, (3) work within raw image inputs. [[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]Again, Tamar et al. 2016 deals with this 3 points.[[BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nI went over the math.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It seems right and valid.[[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Indeed, SNN is a good choice for adding (Bayesian) context to a task.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] Also, I see the advantage of referring only to the \"good\" quantiles when needed.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It is indeed a good method for dealing with the variance.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]] \n\nI must say that I was impressed with the authors making the robot succeed in the tasks in hand (although reaching to an object is fairly simple task). [[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nMy concerns are as follows:\n1) Seems like that the given trajectories are naturally divided with different tasks, i.e., a single trajectory consists only a single task.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY,FBK], [GEN]] For me, this is not the pain point in this tasks.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [FBK], [GEN]] the pain point is knowing when tasks are begin and end.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n2) I'm not sure, and I haven't seen evidence in the paper (or other references) that SNN is the only (optimal?) method for this context.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Why not adding (non Bayesian) context (not label) to the task will not work as well?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] \n3) the robot task is impressive.[[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but proving the point, and for the ease of comparing to different tasks, and since we want to show the validity of the work on more than 200 trials, isn't showing the task on some simulation is better for understanding the different regimes that this method has advantage?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] I know how hard is to make robotic tasks work...   \n4) I\u2019m not sure that the comparison of the suggested architecture to one without any underlying additional variable Z or context (i.e., non-Bayesian setup) is fair. [[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG,SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\"Vanilla\" NN indeed may fail miserably .[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] So, the comparison should be to any other work that can deal with \"similar environment but different details\".[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nTo summarize, I like the work and I can see clearly the motivation.[[RWK-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] But I think some more work is needed in this work: comparing to the right current state of the art, and show that in principal (by demonstrating on other simpler simulations domains) that this method is better than other methods.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]  \n\n"
