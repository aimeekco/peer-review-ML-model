"\nI thank the authors for the thoughtful response and updated manuscript.[[EXT-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] After reading through both, my review score remains unchanged.[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\n=================\n\nThe authors describe a new variant of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating images.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This model employs a 'projection discriminator' in order to incorporate image labels and demonstrate that the resulting model outperforms state-of-the-art GAN models.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nMajor comments:\n1) Spatial resolution. What spatial resolution is the model generating images at?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] The AC-GAN work performed an analysis to assess how information is being introduced at each spatial resolution by assessing the gains in the Inception score versus naively resizing the image.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] It is not clear how much the gains of this model is due to generating better lower resolution images and performing simple upscaling.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It would be great to see the authors address this issue in a serious manner.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n2) FID in real data. The numbers in Table 1 appear favorable to the projection model.[[TNF-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Please add error bars (based on Figure 4, I would imagine they are quite large).[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Additionally, would it be possible to compute this statistic for *real* images?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] I would be curious to know what the FID looks like as a 'gold standard'.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\n3) Conditional batch normalization.  I am not clear how much of the gains arose from employing conditional batch normalization versus the proposed method for incorporating the projection based discriminator. [[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]The former has been seen to be quite powerful in accomodating multi-modal tasks (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07871, https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07629\n). [[RWK-POS,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]If the authors could provide some evidence highlighting the marginal gains of one technique, that would be extremely helpful.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nMinor comments:\n- I believe you have the incorrect reference for conditional batch normalization on Page 5.[[BIB-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]]\nA Learned Representation For Artistic Style[[BIB-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\nDumoulin, Shlens and Kudlur (2017)\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07629[[BIB-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n- Please enlarge images in Figure 5-8. Hard to see the detail of 128x128 images.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n- Please add citations for Figures 1a-1b.[[TNF-NEU,BIB-NEG], [null], [SUG], [MIN]] Do these correspond with some known models?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nDepending on how the authors respond to the reviews, I would consider upgrading the score of my review."[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]
