"This paper aims to provide a continuous variant of CNN.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The main idea is to apply CNN on Hilbert maps of the data.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The data is mapped to a continuous Hilbert space via a reproducing kernel and a convolution layer is defined using the kernel matrix.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A convolutional Hilbert layer algorithm is introduced and evaluated on image classification data sets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is well written and provides some new insights on incorporating kernels in CNN.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe kernel matrix in Eq. 5 is not symmetric and the kernel function in Eq. 3 is not defined over a pair of inputs.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] In this case, the projections of the data via the kernel are not necessarily in a RKHS.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The connection between Hilbert maps and RKHS in that sense is not clear in the paper.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe size of a kernel matrix depends on the sample size.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] In large scale situations, working with the kernel matrix can be computational expensive.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It is not clear how this issue is addressed in this paper.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn section 2.2, how \\mu_i and \\sigma_i are computed?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nHow the proposed approach can be compared to convolutional kernel networks (NIPS paper) of Mairal et al.
