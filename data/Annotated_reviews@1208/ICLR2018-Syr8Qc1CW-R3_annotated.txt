"Pros:\n1. A new DNA structure GAN is utilized to manipulate/disentangle attributes.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]]\n\n2. Non attribute part (Z) is explicitly modeled in the framework.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]]\n\n3. Based on the experiment results, this proposed method outperformed previous methods (TD-GAN, IcGAN).[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n1. It assumes that each individual piece represents an independent factor of variation, which can not hold all the time.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The authors also admit that when two factors are dependent, this method might fail.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n2. In Lreconstruct, only min difference between A and A1 is considered.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] How about A and A2 here?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] It seems that A2 should also be similar with A since only one bit in A2 and A1 is different.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n3. Only one attribute can be \"manipulated\" each time?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is it possible to change more than one attribute each time in this method?"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
