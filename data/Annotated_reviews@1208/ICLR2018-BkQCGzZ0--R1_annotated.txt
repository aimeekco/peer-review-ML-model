"The topic is interesting however the description in the paper is lacking clarity.[[PDI-POS], [CLA-NEG], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper is written in a procedural fashion - I first did that, then I did that and after that I did third.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Having proper mathematical description and good diagrams of what you doing would have immensely helped.[[MET-NEG,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MAJ]] Another big issue is the lack of proper validation in Section 3.4.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Even if you do not know what metric to use to objectively compare your approach versus baseline there are plenty of fields suffering from a similar problem yet  doing subjective evaluations, such as listening tests in speech synthesis.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Given that I see only one example I can not objectively know if your model produces examples like that 'each' time so having just one example is as good as having none.
