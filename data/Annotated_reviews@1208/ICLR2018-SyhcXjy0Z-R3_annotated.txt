"This paper is an application paper on detecting when a face is disguised,[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] however it is poorly written and do not contribute much in terms of novelty of the approach.[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The application domain is interesting,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] however it is simply a classification problem[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe paper is written clearly[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] (with mistakes in an equation), however, it does not contribute much in terms of novelty or new ideas.[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nTo make the paper better, more empirical results are needed.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MAJ]] In addition, it would be useful to investigate how this particular problem is different than a binary classification problem using CNNs.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nNotes:\nEquation 2 has a typo, '*'"
