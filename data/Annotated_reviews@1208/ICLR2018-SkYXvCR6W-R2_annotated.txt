"The manuscript proposed to use prefix codes to compress the input to a neural network for text classification.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It builds upon the work by Zhang & LeCun (2015) where the same tasks are used.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n\nThere are several issues with the paper and I cannot recommend acceptance of the paper in the current state.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]] \n- It looks like it is not finished.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n- the datasets are not described properly.[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n- It is not clear to me where the baseline results come from.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n They do not match up to the Zhang paper (I have tried to find the matching accuracies there).[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- It is not clear to me what the baselines actually are or how I can found more info on those.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- the results are not remarkable.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nBecause of this, the paper needs to be updated and cleaned up before it can be properly reviewed.[[OAL-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nOn top of this, I do not enjoy the style the paper is written in, the language is convoluted.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \nFor example: \u201cThe effort to use Neural Convolution Networks for text classification tasks is justified by the possibility of appropriating tools from the recent developments of techniques, libraries and hardware used especially in the image classification \u201c[[MET-NEG, OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nI do not know which message the paper tries to get across here.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \nAs a reviewer my impression (which is subjective) is that the authors used difficult language to make the manuscript look more impressive.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nThe acknowledgements should not be included here either. \n\n"[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
