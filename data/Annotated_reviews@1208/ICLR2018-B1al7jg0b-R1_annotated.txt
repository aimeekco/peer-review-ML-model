"The paper leaves me guessing which part is a new contribution, and which one is already possible with conceptors as described in the Jaeger 2014 report.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Figure (1) in the paper is identical to the one in the (short version of) the Jaeger report but is missing an explicit reference.[[TNF-NEG,BIB-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Figure 2 is almost identical, again a reference to the original would be better.[[RWK-NEG,TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nConceptors can be trained with a number of approaches (as described both in the 2014 Jaeger tech report and in the JMLR paper), including ridge regression.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] What I am missing here is a clear indication what is an original contribution of the paper, and what is already possible using the original approach.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG,OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The fact that additional conceptors can be trained does not appear new for the approach described here.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [NOV-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] If the presented approach was an improvement over the original conceptors, the evaluation should compare the new and the original version.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe evaluation also leaves me a little confused in an additional dimension: the paper title and abstract suggested that the contribution is about overcoming catastrophic forgetting.[[ABS-NEG,INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The evaluation shows that the approach performs better classifying MNIST digits than another approach.[[DAT-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] This is nice but doesn't really tell me much about overcoming catastrophic forgetting. \n"[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]
