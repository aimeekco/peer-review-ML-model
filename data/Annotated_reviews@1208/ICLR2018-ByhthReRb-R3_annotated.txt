"Properly capturing named entities for goal oriented dialog is essential, for instance location, time and cuisine for restaurant reservation.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Mots successful approaches have argued for separate mechanism for NE captures, that rely on various hacks and tricks.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This paper attempt to propose a comprehensive approach offers intriguing new ideas, but is too preliminary, both in the descriptions and experiments.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe proposed methods and experiments are not understandable in the current way the paper is written: there is not a single equation, pseudo-code algorithm or pointer to real code to enable the reader to get a detailed understanding of the process.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] All we have a besides text is a small figure (figure 1).[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Then we have to trust the authors that on their modified dataset, the accuracies of the proposed method is around 100% while not using this method yields 0% accuracies?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\nThe initial description (section 2)  leaves way too many unanswered questions:\n- What embeddings are used for words detected as NE?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] Is it the same as the generated representation?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- What is the exact mechanism of generating a representation for NE EECS545?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] (end of page 2)\n- Is it correct that the same representation stored in the NE table is used twice?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] (a) To retrieve the key (a vector) given the value (a string)  as the encoder input.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] (b) To find the value that best matches a key at the decoder stage?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- Exact description of the column attention mechanism: some similarity between a key embedding and embeddings representing each column? Multiplicative? Additive?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n- How is the system supervised?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] Do we need to give the name of the column the Attention-Column-Query attention should focus on?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Because of this unknown, I could not understand the experiment setup and data formatting![[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe list goes on...\n\nFor such a complex architecture, the authors must try to analyze separate modules as much as possible.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] As neither the QA and the Babi tasks use the RNN dialog manager, while not start with something that only works at the sentence level.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nThe Q&A task could be used to describe a simpler system with only a decoder accessing the DB table.[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Complexity for solving the Babi tasks could be added later.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n"
