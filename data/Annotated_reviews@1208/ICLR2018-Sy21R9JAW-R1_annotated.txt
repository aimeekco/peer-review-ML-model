"This paper discusses several gradient based attribution methods, which have been popular for the fast computation of saliency maps for interpreting deep neural networks.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper provides several advances:\n- \\epsilon-LRP and DeepLIFT are formulated in a way that can be calculated using the same back-propagation as training.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- This gives a more unified way of understanding, and implementing the methods.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- The paper points out situations when the methods are equivalent[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- The paper analyses the methods' sensitivity to identifying single and joint regions of sensitivity[[MET-NEU, ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- The paper proposes a new objective function to measure joint sensitivity[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall, I believe this paper to be a useful contribution to the literature.[[OAL-POS], [APR-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It both solidifies understanding of existing methods and provides new insight into quantitate ways of analysing methods.[[MET-POS, ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Especially the latter will be appreciated."[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]
