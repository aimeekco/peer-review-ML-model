"The main contribution of the paper is a method that provides visual explanations of classification decisions.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed method uses \n - a generator trained in a GAN setup\n - an autoencoder to obtain a latent space representation\n - a method inspired by adversarial sample generation to obtain a generated image from another class - which can then be compared to the original image (or rather the reconstruction of it). [[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe method is evaluated on a medical images dataset and some additional demonstration on MNIST is provided.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n\n - The paper proposes a (I believe) novel method to obtain visual explanations.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The results are visually compelling[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] although most results are shown on a medical dataset - which I feel is very hard for most readers to follow.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The MNIST explanations help a lot.[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  It would be great if the authors could come up with an additional way to demonstrate their method to the non-medical reader.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n - The paper shows that the results are plausible using a neat trick.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The authors train their system with the testdata included which leads to very different visualizations.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] It would be great if this analysis could be performed for MNIST as well.[[DAt-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n\nFrom the related work, it would be nice to mention that generative models (p(x|c)) also often allow for explaining their decisions, e.g. the work by Lake and Tenenbaum on probabilistic program induction.\nAlso, there is the work by Hendricks et al on Generating Visual Explanations.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] This should probably also be referenced.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nminor comments: \n- some figures with just two parts are labeled \"from left to right\" - it would be better to just write left: ... right: ...\[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]n- figure 2: do these images correspond to each other?[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] If yes, it would be good to show them pairwise.\n- figure 5: please explain why the saliency map is relevant.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This looks very noisy and non-interesting.\n\n"[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
