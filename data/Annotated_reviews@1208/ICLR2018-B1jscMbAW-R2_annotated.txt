"This paper studies problems that can be solved using a dynamic programming approach and proposes a neural network architecture called Divide and Conquer Networks (DCN) to solve such problems.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The network has two components: one component learns to split the problem and the other learns to combine solutions to sub-problems.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Using this setup, the authors are able to beat sequence to sequence baselines on problems that are amenable to such an approach.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] In particular the authors test their approach on computing convex hulls, computing a minimum cost k-means clustering, and the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) problem.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In all three cases, the proposed solution outperforms the baselines on larger problem instances.
