"# Summary and Assessment\n\nThe paper addresses an important issue\u2013that of making learning of recurrent networks tractable for sequence lengths well beyond 1\u2019000s of time steps.[[PDI-POS,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A key problem here is that processing such sequences with ordinary RNNs requires a reduce operation, where the output of the net at time step t depends on the outputs of *all* its predecessor.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] \nThe authors now make a crucial observation, namely that a certain class of RNNs allows evaluation in a non-linear fashion through a so-called SCAN operator.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Here, if certain conditions are satisfied, the calculation of the output   can be parallelised massively.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nIn the following, the authors explore the landscape of RNNs satisfying the necessary conditions.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The performance is investigated in terms of wall clock time. [[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]Further, experimental results of problems with previously untacked sequence lengths are reported.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is certainly relevant, as it can pave the way towards the application of recurrent architectures to problems that have extremely long term dependencies.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\nTo me, the execution seems sound.[[EXP-POS,OAL-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The experiments back up the claim.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n## Minor\n- I challenge the claim that thousands and millions of time steps are a common issue in \u201crobotics, remote sensing, control systems, speech recognition, medicine and finance\u201d, as claimed in the first paragraph of the introduction.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] IMHO, most problems in these domains get away with a few hundred time steps; nevertheless, I\u2019d appreciate a few examples where this is a case to better justify the method.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]"
