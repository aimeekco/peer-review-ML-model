"In this paper, the authors studied the problem of semi-supervised few-shot classification, by extending the prototypical networks into the setting of semi-supervised learning with examples from distractor classes. [[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The studied problem is interesting, and the paper is well-written.[[PDI-POS], [CLA-POS,IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. [[EXP-POS,MET-NEU], [SUB-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] While the proposed method is a natural extension of the existing works (i.e., soft k-means and meta-learning).[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]On top of that, It seems the authors have over-claimed their model capability at the first place as the proposed model cannot properly classify the distractor examples but just only consider them as a single class of outliers.[[PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Overall, I would like to vote for a weakly acceptance regarding this paper.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG,REC-NEG], [CRT,FBK], [MIN]]"
