"Summary:\nThis work is about model evaluation for molecule generation and design.[[ABS-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] 19 benchmarks are proposed, small data sets are expanded to a large, standardized data set and it is explored how to apply new RL techniques effectively for molecular design.[[PDI-POS,DAT-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS,ANA-POS], [SUB-POS,IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\non the positive side:[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe paper is well written, quality and clarity of the work are good.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The work provides a good overview about how to apply new reinforcement learning techniques for sequence generation.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS,MET-POS], [SUB-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [GEN]] It is investigated how several RL strategies perform on a large, standardized data set.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Different RL models like Hillclimb-MLE, PPO, GAN, A2C are investigated and discussed.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  An implementation of 19 suggested benchmarks of relevance for de novo design will be provided as open source as an OpenAI Gym.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] \n\n\non the negative side:[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]\nThere is no new novel contribution on the methods side.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]  \n\n\n\nminor comments:\n\nSection 2.1. \nsee Fig.2 \u2014> see Fig.1\npage 4just before equation 8: the the"[[RWK-NEU,EXT-NEU], [CNT], [SMY], [GEN]]
