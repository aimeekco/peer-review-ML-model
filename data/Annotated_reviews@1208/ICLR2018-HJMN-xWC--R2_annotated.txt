"This paper introduces a skip-connection based design of fully connected networks, which is loosely based on learning latent variable tree structure learning via mutual information criteria. [[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]The goal is to learn sparse structures across layers of fully connected networks.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  Compared to prior work (hierarchical latent tree model), this work introduces skip-paths.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \nAuthors refer to prior work for methods to learn this backbone model. Liu et.al (http://www.cse.ust.hk/~lzhang/ltm/index.htm) and Chen et.al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00973) and (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06650.pdf).[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nAs far as I understand, the methods for learning backbone structure and the skip-path are performed independently, i.e. there is no end-to-end training of the structure and parameters of the layers.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This will limit the applicability of the approach in most applications where fully connected networks are currently used.[[MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nOriginality - The paper heavily builds upon prior work on hierarchical latent tree analysis and adds 'skip path' formulation to the architecture, however the structure learning is not performed end-to-end and in conjunction with the parameters.[[RWK-NEU,OAL-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] \n\nClarity - The paper is not self-contained in terms of methodology.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nQuality and Significance - There is a disconnect between premise of the paper (improving efficiency of fully connected layers by learning sparser structures) and applicability of the approach (slow EM based method to learn structure first, then learn the parameters).[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  As is, the applicability of the method is limited.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] \nAlso in terms of experiments, there is not enough exploration of simpler sparse learning methods such as heavy regularization of the weights.
