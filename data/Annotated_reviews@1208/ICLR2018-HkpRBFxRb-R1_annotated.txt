"SUMMARY\nThe major contribution of the paper is a generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns (CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an end-to-end manner. [[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  These CARs are used in the A3C algorithm.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The weights are based on the confidence of the value function of the n-step return.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  Even though this idea in not new[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] the authors propose a simple and robust approach for doing it by using the value function estimation network of A3C.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nDuring experiments, the autodidactic returns perform better only half of the time as compared to lambda returns.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\n\nCOMMENTS\nThe j-step returns TD error is not written correctly[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn Figure 1 it is not obvious how the confidence of the values is estimated.[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nFigure 1 is unreadable.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n\nA lighter version of Algorithm 1 in Appendix F should be moved in the text, since this is the novelty of the paper.\n"[[OAL-NEU], [NOV-NEU,PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
