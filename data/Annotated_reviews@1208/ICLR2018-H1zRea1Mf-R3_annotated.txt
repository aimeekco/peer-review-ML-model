"This paper proposes to use a hybrid of convolutional and recurrent networks to predict the DSL specification of a GUI given a screenshot of the GUI.\[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]n\n\nPros:\n\n\nThe paper is clear and the proposed problem is novel and well-defined.[[INT-POS,PDI-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe training data is synthetic, allowing for arbitrarily large training sets to be generated.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]  The authors have made their synthetic dataset publicly available.\[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]n\nThe method seems to work well based on the samples and ROC curves presented.[[MET-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n\nCons:\n\nThis is mostly an application of an existing method to a new domain -[[MET-POS], [SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]- as stated in the related work section, effectively the same convnet+RNN architecture has been in common use for image captioning and other vision applications.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe UIs that are represented in the dataset seem quite simple; it\u2019s not clear that this will transfer to arbitrarily complex and multi-page UIs.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe main motivation for the proposed system seems to be for non-technical designers to be able to implement UIs just by drawing a mockup screenshot[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]].  However, the paper hasn\u2019t shown that this is necessarily possible assuming the hand-designed mockups aren\u2019t pixel-for-pixel matches with a screenshot that could be generated by the \u201cDSL code -> screenshot\u201d mapping that this system learns to invert.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThere exist a number of \u201cdrag and drop\u201d style UI design products (at least for HTML) that would seem to accomplish the same basic goal as the proposed system in a more reliable way.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [SUB-NEU,IMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] (Though the proposed system does have the advantage of only requiring a screenshot created using any software, rather than being restricted to a particular piece of software.)[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written but the novelty and applicability seems a bit limited.[[INT-NEU], [CLA-POS,NOV-NEG], [SMY], [GEN]]"
