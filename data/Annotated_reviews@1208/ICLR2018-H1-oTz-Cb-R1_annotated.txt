"The paper proposes an approach to learning a distribution over filters of a CNN.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The method is based on a adversarial training: the generator produces filters, and the discriminator aims to distinguish the activation maps produced by real filters from those produced by the generated ones.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nPros:\n1) The general task of learning distributions over network weights is interesting[[MET-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]\n2) To my knowledge, the proposed approach is new[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n1) Experimental evaluation is very substandard. The experiments on invariances seem to be the highlight of the paper, but they basically do not tell me anything. [[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n - Figures 3 and 4 take 2 pages, but what should one see there?[[TNF-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n - There are no quantitative results.[[RES-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MAJ]] Could there be a way to measure the invariances?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n - Can the results be applied to some practical task? Why are the results interesting and/or useful?[[RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n2) The experiments are restricted to a single dataset - MNIST.  The authors mention that \u201cthe test accuracy obtained by following the above procedure is of 0.982, against a test accuracy of 0.971 for the real CNN\u201d - these are very poor accuracies for MNIST. So even the MNIST results do not seem convincing.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEU,RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n3) Presentation is suboptimal, and many details are missing. For instance, architectures of networks are not provided.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n \nTo conclude, while the general direction is interesting and the proposed method might work, the experimental evaluation is very poor, and the paper absolutely cannot be accepted for publication."[[PDI-POS,EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]
