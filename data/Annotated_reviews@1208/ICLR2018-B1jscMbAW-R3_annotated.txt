"Summary of paper:\n\nThe paper proposes a unique network architecture that can learn divide-and-conquer strategies to solve algorithmic tasks.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nReview:\n\nThe paper is clearly written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It is sometimes difficult to communicate ideas in this area, so I appreciate the author's effort in choosing good notation.[[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Using an architecture to learn how to split the input, find solutions, then merge these is novel.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Previous work in using recursion to solve problems (Cai 2017) used explicit supervision to learn how to split and recurse.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The ideas and formalism of the merge and partition operations are valuable contributions.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  \n\nThe experimental side of the paper is less strong.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  There are good results on the convex hull problem, which is promising.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  There should also be a comparison to a k-means solver in the k-means section as an additional baseline.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  I'm also not sure TSP is an appropriate problem to demonstrate the method's effectiveness.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  Perhaps another problem that has an explicit divide and conquer strategy could be used instead.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  It would also be nice to observe failure cases of the model.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  This could be done by visually showing the partition constructed or seeing how the model learned to merge solutions..[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThis is a relatively new area to tackle, so while the experiments section could be strengthened, I think the ideas present in the paper are important and worth publishing.[[PDI-POS,MET-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What is \\rho on page 4?.[[CNT], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] I assume it is some nonlinearity, but this was not specified.[[CNT], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n2. On page 5, it says the merge block takes as input two sequences.[[CNT], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] I thought the merge block was defined on sets?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\nTypos:\n1. Author's names should be enclosed in parentheses unless part of the sentence.[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n2. I believe \"then\" should be removed in the sentence \"...scale invariance, then exploiting...\" on page 2."[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
