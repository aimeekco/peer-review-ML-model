"This paper applies the word pairs, instead to bag of words, to current RBM models[[INT-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]]. The word pairs are extracted using Stanford parser[[MET-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]]. The word pairs are further filtered and clustered to improve the representation[[MET-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]]. The experiments show improvement over baselines.[[EXP-POS], [NULL], [SMY], [MAJ]]\n\nHowever, I think this paper has limited contribution and novelty,[[OAL-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]] and the experiments also need to be improved[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]. The detailed comments are as follows:\n\n- The main contribution of this paper is to apply word pairs instead of words to RBM models[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]]. However, the main techniques such as RBM, parser to extract word pairs, tf-idf for filtering, and k-means for clustering, are all existing standard techniques.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] It is more like an application of these methods, and has limited contribution and novelty.[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\n- For experiments, they apply k-means clustering in the process so k is one parameter to tune. K needs to be tuned on validation set instead of testing set. [[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This paper simply presents the results of different parameter k on testing set directly.[[RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n- The structure of Section 3 needs to be improved.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]] Instead of listing each step in each subsection, a general introduction picture should be introduced first. More intuition is also needed for each step.[[INT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]] \n\n- Some figures and tables are overlapping in the experiments. Just keep one is enough.[[EXP-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n- The format of reference should be fixed in this paper."[[BIB-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
