"This paper introduces a generative approach for 3D point clouds.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] More specifically, two Generative Adversarial approaches are introduced: Raw point cloud GAN, and Latent-space GAN (r-GAN and l-GAN as referred to in the paper).[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In addition, a GMM sampling + GAN decoder approach to generation is also among the experimented variations. [[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe results look convincing for the generation experiments in the paper, both from class-specific (Figure 1) and multi-class generators (Figure 6).[[RES-POS,TNF-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The quantitative results also support the visuals.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nOne question that arises is whether the point cloud approaches to generation is any more valuable compared to voxel-grid based approaches.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Especially Octree based approaches [1-below] show very convincing and high-resolution shape generation results,[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] whereas the details seem to be washed out for the point cloud results presented in this paper.[[RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nI would like to see comparison experiments with voxel based approaches in the next update for the paper.[[EXP-NEU,FWK-NEU], [SUB-NEU,IMP-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]] \n\n[1]\n@article{tatarchenko2017octree,\n  title={Octree Generating Networks: Efficient Convolutional Architectures for High-resolution 3D Outputs},\n  author={Tatarchenko, Maxim and Dosovitskiy, Alexey and Brox, Thomas},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.09438},\n  year={2017}\n}\n\nIn light of the authors' octree updates score is updated.[[FWK-NEU], [SUB-NEU,IMP-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]] I expect these updates to be reflected in the final version of the paper itself as well.
