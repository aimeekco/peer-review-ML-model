"This paper views graph classification as image classification, and shows that the CNN model adapted from image net can be effectively adapted to the graph classification.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The idea is interesting and the result looks promising,[[PDI-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but I do not understand the intuition behind the success of analogizing graph with images.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nFundamentally, a convolutional filter stands for a operation within a small neighborhood on the image.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] However, it is unclear how it means for the graph representation.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Is the neighborhood predefined?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Are the graph nodes pre-ordered? [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nI am also curious with the effect of pre-trained model from ImageNet.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Since the graph presentation does not use color channels,  pre-trained model is used different from what it was designed to.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] I would imagine the benefit of using ImageNet is just to bring a random, high-dimensional embedding.[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  In addition, I wonder whether it will help to fine-tune the model on the graph classification data.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] Could this submission show some fine-tune experiments?"[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
