"In this paper, the authors present an adaptation of space-by-time non-negative matrix factorization (SbT-NMF) that can rigorously account for the pre-stimulus baseline activity. [[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]The authors go on to compare their baseline-corrected (BC) method with several established methods for dimensionality reduction of spike train data.\n\n[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]Overall, the results are a bit mixed.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The BC method often performs similarly to or is outperformed by non-BC SbT-NMF.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The authors provide a possible mechanism to explain these results, by analyzing classification performance as a function of baseline firing rate.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The authors posit that their method can be useful when sensory responses are on the order of magnitude of baseline activity; however, this doesn't fully address why non-BC SbT-NMF can strongly outperform the BC method in certain tasks (e.g. the step of light, Fig. 3b).[[MET-NEG,TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN,CRT], [MIN]] Finally, while this method introduces a principled way to remove mean baseline activity from the sensory-driven response, this may also discount the effect that baseline firing rate and fast temporal fluctuations can have on the response (Destexhe et al., Nature Reviews Neuroscience 4, 2003; Gutnisky DA et al., Cerebral Cortex 27, 2017)."[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]
