"This paper learns to construct masks and feature representations from an input image, in order to represent objects.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This is applied to the relatively simple domain of Atari games video input (compared to natural images).[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper is completely inadequate in respect to related work; it re-invents known techniques like non-maximum suppression and matching for tracking; fails to learn convincing objects according to visual inspection; and fails to compare with earlier methods for these tasks.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,SUB-NEG], [SMY], [GEN]] (The comment above about re-invention is the most charitable intepretation -- the worst case would be using these ideas without citation.)[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\n\n1) The related work section is outrageous, containing no references before 2016.[[RWK-NEG], [CNT], [DFT], [MAJ]]  Do the authors think researchers never tried to do this task before then?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] This is the bad side of the recent deep nets hype, and ICLR is particularly susceptible to this.[[EXT-NEG], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Examples include\n\n@article{wang-adelson-94,\n  author        = \"Wang,  J.
