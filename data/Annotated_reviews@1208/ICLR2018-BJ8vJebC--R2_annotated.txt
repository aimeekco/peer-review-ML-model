"This paper empirically investigates the performance of character-level NMT systems in the face of character-level noise, both synthesized and natural.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The results are not surprising:\n\n* NMT is terrible with noise.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n* But it improves on each noise type when it is trained on that noise type.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nWhat I like about this paper is that:\n\n1) The experiments are very carefully designed and thorough.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n2) This problem might actually matter.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Out of curiosity, I ran the example (Table 4) through Google Translate, and the result was gibberish.[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] But as the paper shows, it\u2019s easy to make NMT robust to this kind of noise, and Google (and other NMT providers) could do this tomorrow.[[EXP-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] So this paper could have real-world impact.[[OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n3) Most importantly, it shows that NMT\u2019s handling of natural noise does *not* improve when trained with synthetic noise; that is, the character of natural noise is very different.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] So solving the problem of natural noise is not so simple\u2026 it\u2019s a *real* problem.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Speculating, again: commercial MT providers have access to exactly the kind of natural spelling correction data that the researchers use in this paper, but at much larger scale.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] So these methods could be applied in the real world.[[MET-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] (It would be excellent if an outcome of this paper was that commercial MT providers answered it\u2019s call to provide more realistic noise by actually providing examples.)[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThere are no fancy new methods or state-of-the-art numbers in this paper.[[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] But it\u2019s careful, curiosity-driven empirical research of the type that matters, and it should be in ICLR."[[OAL-POS], [APR-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
