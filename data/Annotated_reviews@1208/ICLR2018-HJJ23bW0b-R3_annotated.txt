"This paper investigates the Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks (PSRNN) model that embed the predictive states in a Reproducible Hilbert Kernel Space and then update the predictive states given new observation in this space.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nWhile PSRNN usually uses random features to project the map the states in a new space where dot product approximates the kernel well, the authors proposes to leverage orthogonal random features.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nIn particular, authors provide theoretical guarantee and show that the model using orthogonal features has a smaller upper bound on the failure probability regarding the empirical risk than the model using unstructured randomness.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nAuthors then empirically validate their model on several small-scale datasets where they compare their model with PSRNN and LSTM.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They observe that PSRNN with orthogonal random features leads to lower MSE on test set than both PSRNN and LSTM and seem to reach lower value earlier in training.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nQuestion:\n-\tWhat is the cost of constructing orthogonal random features compared to RF?[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n-\tWhat is the definition of H the Hadamard matrix in the discrete orthogonal joint definition?[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n-\tWhat are the hyperparameters values use for the LSTM\[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]n-\tEmpirical evaluations seem to use relatively small datasets composed by few dozens of temporal trajectories.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Did you consider larger dataset for evaluation?[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] \n-\tHow did you select the maximum number of epochs in Figure 5?[[EXP-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU,PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] It seems that the validation error is still decreasing after 25 epochs?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\nPros:\n-\tProvide theoretical guarantee for the use of orthogonal random features in the context of PSRNN[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nCons:\n-\tEmpirical evaluation only on small scale datasets.\n"[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
