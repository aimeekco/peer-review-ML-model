"his paper proposes a deep learning framework to predict somatic mutations at extremely low frequencies which occurs in detecting tumor from cell-free DNA.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They key innovation is a convolutional architecture that represents the invariance around the target base.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The method is validated on simulations as well as in cfDNA and is s\nhown to provide increased precision over competing methods.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nWhile the method is of interest, there are more recent mutation callers that should be compared.[[MET-POS], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] For example, Snooper which uses a RandomForest  (https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-3281-2) and hence would be of interest as another machine learning framework.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] They also should compare to Strelka whic\nh interestingly they included only to make final calls of mutations but not in the comparison.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nFurther, I  would also have liked to see the use of standard benchmark datasets for mutation calling ( https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10001)[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]].\n\nIt appears that the proposed method (Kittyhawk) has a steep decrease in PPV and enrichment for low tumor fraction which are presumably the parameter of greatest interest. The authors should explore this behavior in greater detail."[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
