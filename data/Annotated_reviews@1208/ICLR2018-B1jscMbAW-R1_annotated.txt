"This paper proposes to add new inductive bias to neural network architecture - namely a divide and conquer strategy know from algorithmics.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Since introduced model has to split data into subsets, it leads to non-differentiable paths in the graph, which authors propose to tackle with RL and policy gradients.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The whole model can be seen as an RL agent, trained to do splitting action on a set of instances in such a way, that jointly trained predictor T quality is maximised (and thus its current log prob: log p(Y|P(X)) becomes a reward for an RL agent).[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Authors claim that model like this (strengthened with pointer networks/graph nets etc. depending on the application) leads to empirical improvement on three tasks - convex hull finding, k-means clustering and on TSP.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  However, while results on convex hull task are good,[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] k-means ones use a single, artificial problem (and do not test DCN, but rather a part of it), and on TSP DCN performs significantly worse than baselines in-distribution, and is better when tested on bigger problems than it is trained on.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] However the generalisation scores themselves are pretty bad thus it is not clear if this can be called a success story.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nI will be happy to revisit the rating if the experimental section is enriched.[[EXP-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\nPros:\n- very easy to follow idea and model[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- simple merge or RL and SL in an end-to-end trainable model\n- improvements over previous solutions[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n- K-means experiments should not be run on artificial dataset, there are plenty of benchmarking datasets out there.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In current form it is just a proof of concept experiment rather than evaluation (+ if is only for splitting, not for the entire architecture proposed).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It would be also beneficial to see the score normalised by the cost found by k-means itself (say using Lloyd's method), as otherwise numbers are impossible to interpret.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] With normalisation, claiming that it finds 20% worse solution than k-means is indeed meaningful.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n- TSP experiments show that \"in distribution\" DCN perform worse than baselines, and when generalising to bigger problems they fail more gracefully, however the accuracies on higher problem are pretty bad, thus it is not clear if they are significant enough to claim success.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Maybe TSP is not the best application of this kind of approach (as authors state in the paper - it is not clear how merging would be applied in the first place).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n- in general - experimental section should be extended, as currently the only convincing success story lies in convex hull experiments[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]]\n\nSide notes:\n- DCN is already quite commonly used abbreviation for \"Deep Classifier Network\" as well as \"Dynamic Capacity Network\", thus might be a good idea to find different name.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- please fix \\cite calls to \\citep, when authors name is not used as part of the sentence, for example:\nGraph Neural Network Nowak et al.
