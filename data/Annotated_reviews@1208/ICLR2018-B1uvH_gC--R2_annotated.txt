"The authors argue that the spectral dimensionality reduction techniques are too slow, due to the complexity of computing the eigenvalue decomposition, and that they are not suitable for out-of-sample extension.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They also note the limitation of neural networks, which require huge amounts of data to properly learn the data structure.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors therefore propose to first sub-sample the data and afterwards to learn an MDS-like cost function directly with a neural network, resulting in a parametric framework.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper should be checked for grammatical errors, such as e.g. consistent use of (no) hyphen in low-dimensional (or low dimensional).[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe abbreviations should be written out on the first use, e.g. MLP, MDS, LLE, etc.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nIn the introduction the authors claim that the complexity of parametric techniques does not depend on the number of data points, or that moving to parametric techniques would reduce memory and computational complexities.[[DAT-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] This is in general not true.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Even if the number of parameters is small, learning them might require complex computations on the whole data set.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] On the other hand, even if the number of parameters is equal to the number of data points, the computations could be trivial, thus resulting in a complexity of O(N).[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn section 2.1, the authors claim \"Spectral techniques are non-parametric in nature\"; this is wrong again.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] E.g. PCA can be formulated as MDS (thus spectral), but can be seen as a parametric mapping which can be used to project new words.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nIn section 2.2, it says \"observation that the double centering...\".[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] Can you provide a citation for this?[[BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nIn section 3, the authors propose they technique, which should be faster and require less data than the previous methods, but to support their claim, they do not perform an analysis of computational complexity.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It is not quite clear from the text what the resulting complexity would be.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] With N as number of data points and M as number of landmarks, from the description on page 4 it seems the complexity would be O(N + M^2), but the steps 1 and 2 on page 5 suggest it would be O(N^2 + M^2).[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Unfortunately, it is also not clear what the complexity of previous techniques, e.g DrLim, is.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nFigure 3, contrary to text, does not provide a visualisation to the sampling mechanism.[[TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn the experiments section, can you provide a citation for ADAM and explain how the parameters were selected?[[BIB-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MAJ]] Also, it is not meaningful to measure the quality of a visualisation via the MDS fit.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] There are more useful approaches to this task, such as the quality framework [*].[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn figure 4a, x-axis should be \"number of landmarks\".[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nIt is not clear why the equation 6 holds.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Citation?[[BIB-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]\nIt is also not clear how exactly the equation 7 is evaluated.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It says \"By varying the number of layers and the number of nodes...\", but the nodes and layer are not a part of the equation.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe notation for equation 8 is not explained.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nFigure 6a shows visualisations by different techniques and is evaluated \"by looking at it\".[[TNF-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Again, use [*].\n\n[*] Lee, John Aldo ; Verleysen, Michel.
