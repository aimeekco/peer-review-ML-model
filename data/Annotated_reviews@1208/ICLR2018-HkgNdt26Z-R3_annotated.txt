"This paper discusses the application of word prediction for software keyboards.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The goal is to customize the predictions for each user to account for member specific information while adhering to the strict compute constraints and privacy requirements.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe authors propose a simple method of mixing the global model with user specific data.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Collecting the user specific models and averaging them to form the next global model.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe proposal is practical.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,SUG], [GEN]] However, I am not convinced that this is novel enough for publication at ICLR.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG,SUB-NEG,REC-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]] \n\nOne major question.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] The authors assume that the global model will depict general english.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] However, it is not necessary that the population of users will adhere to general English and hence the averaged model at the next time step t+1 might be significantly different from general English.[[RWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] It is not clear to me as how this mechanism guarantees that it will not over-fit or that there will be no catastrophic forgetting.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]"
