"This paper is an extension of the recent language style transfer method without parallel training pairs (Shen et al. 2017).[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The author extend the  original algorithm from two-folds:\n\n1. A style discrepancy loss that pushes the style vector of the sentences away from target style[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \n2. A cycle consistency loss that makes sure the content vector of transferred sentences and style vector of the original sentence should be able to reconstruct the original sentences.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  \n\nBoth extensions are reasonable to me.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The experiments further verify the performance gain compared against the baseline.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]  \n\n\nI have several concerns:\n\nMetrics are not very reasonable to me: \n- It does not measure how well the content is preserved.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Style transfer has two key components, the first is how well it is transferred to the target style; second is how well it preserves the original contents.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  However, the metric that using a pre-trained style classification network has issues in terms of evaluating how well the original content is preserved.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  In fact, from the qualitative examples of Yelp, I do not think that the contents are well preserved.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Also it is not clear how good the classifier is.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n- It seems there are only two styles in Yelp dataset, and it's not clear how many styles are there in the \"On Chat\" dataset.[[DAT-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [MIN]]  \n\nThe paper does not clearly describe how D_s is obtained.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  Also in the formulation D_S is not optimised.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  I am wondering how D_S is trained, how the GT labels are obtained and whether it is trained jointly.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  Moreover, is this D_S same as the style classifier used in the metric?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] These are the crucial questions related with fair comparisons, which I would like to know specific answers to make my final decisions.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \n\nMy final decision is dependent on the author's response to my questions.
