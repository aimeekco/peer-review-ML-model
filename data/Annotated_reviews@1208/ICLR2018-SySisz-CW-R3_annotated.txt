"The paper presents an application of a measure of dependence between the input power spectrum and the frequency response of a filter (Spectral Density Ratio from [Shajarisales et al 2015]) to cascades of two filters in successive layers of deep convolutional networks.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors apply their newly defined measure to DCGANs and plain VAEs with ReLUs, and show that dependency between successive layers may lead to bad performance.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper proposed a possibly interesting approach,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but I found it quite hard to follow, especially Section 4, which I thought was quite unstructured.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Also Section 3 could be improved and simplified.[[CNT], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] It would be also good to add some more related work. [[RWK-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]I\u2019m not an expert, but I assume there must be some similar idea in CNNs.[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nFrom my limited point of view, this seems like a sound, novel and potentially useful application of a interesting idea.[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] If the writing was improved, I think the paper may have even more impact.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU,IMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nSmaller details: some spacing issues, some extra punctuation (pg 5 \u201c. . Hence\u201d), a typo (pg. 7 \u201ctraining of the VAE did not lead to values as satisfactory AS what we obtained with the GAN\u201d)\n"[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
