"The authors propose a new CNN approach to graph classification that generalizes previous work.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Instead of considering the direct neighborhood of a vertex in the convolution step, a filter based on outgoing walks of increasing length is proposed.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This incorporates information from more distant vertices in one propagation step.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe proposed idea is not exceptional original,[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] but the paper has several strong points:\n\n* The relation to previous work is made explicit and it is show that several previous approaches are generalized by the proposed one.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n* The paper is clearly written and well illustrated by figures and examples.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The paper is easy to follow although it is on an adequate technical level.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n* The relation between the vertex and spectrum domain is well elaborated and nice (although neither important for understanding nor implementing the approach).[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n* The experimental evaluation appears to be sound.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] A moderate improvement compared to other approaches is observed for all data sets.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nIn summary, I think the paper can be accepted for ICLR.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n----------- EDIT -----------\nAfter reading the publications mentioned by the other reviewers as well as the following related contributions\n\n* Network of Graph Convolutional Networks Trained on Random Walks (under review for ICLR 2018)[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n* Graph Convolution: A High-Order and Adaptive Approach, Zhenpeng Zhou, Xiaocheng Li (arXiv:1706.09916)[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nI agree that the relation to previous work is not adequately outlined.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Therefore I have modified my rating accordingly."[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]
