"I think I should understand the gist of the paper, which is very interesting, where the action of \\tilde Q(s,a) is drawn from a distribution.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] The author also explains in detail the relation with PGQ/Soft Q learning, and the recent paper \"expected policy gradient\" by Ciosek & Whiteson.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] All these seems very sound and interesting.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nWeakness:\n1. The major weakness is that throughout the paper, I do not see an algorithm formulation of the Smoothie algorithm, which is the major algorithmic contribution of the paper (I think the major contribution of the paper is on the algorithmic side instead of theoretical).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Such representation style is highly discouraging and brings about un-necessary readability difficulties.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n2. Sec. 3.3 and 3.4 is a little bit abbreviated from the major focus of the paper, and I guess they are not very important and novel (just educational guess, because I can only guess what the whole algorithm Smoothie is).[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] So I suggest moving them to the Appendix and make the major focus more narrowed down."[[OAL-NEU], [CNT], [SUG], [MIN]]
