"Learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems using recurrent networks is a very interesting research topic.[[INT-POS,EXT-POS], [null], [SMY,APC], [GEN]] However, I had a very hard time understanding the paper.[[EXT-NEG,OAL-NEG], [null], [DIS], [MAJ]] It certainly doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m not familiar with the architectures the model is based on, nor with state-of-the-art integer programming solvers.[[EXT-NEG], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe architecture was described but not really motivated.[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The authors chose to study only random instances which are known to be bad representatives of real-world problmes, instead of picking a standard benchmark problem. [[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]Furthermore, the insights on how the network is actually solving the problems and how the proposed components contribute to the solution are minimal, if any.\n\n[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]The experimental issues (especially regarding the baseline) raised by the anonymous comments below were rather troubling; it\u2019s a pity they were left unanswered.\n\n[[EXP-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [CNT]]Hopefully other expert reviewers will be able to provide constructive feedback."[[EXT-NEG], [CNT], [CNT], [GEN]]
