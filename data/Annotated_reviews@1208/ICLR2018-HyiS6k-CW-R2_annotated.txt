"This paper proposes a new space for reasoning about human identity.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It proposes a new dataset based on an artist's work, and compares existing methods in terms of the realism of the synthetic faces they can create.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nPros:\n+ The results are very pleasing visually.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n+ The authors show that one of the existing methods can fairly successfully fool humans to believe its synthetic results are actual human faces.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nCons:\n- There is no new methodology proposed.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- If the main contribution is the dataset, perhaps the claim that it is \"uniquely diverse\" could be justified with some quantitative arguments / statistics, comparing to other datasets.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \n- Since there are existing methods to generate images from a textual description (e.g. Zhang ICCV 2017, \"StackGAN\"), Fig. 10 merits a comparison to those.[[RWK-POS,TNF-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- It would have been convincing to see an experiment showing actual use of the proposed method for navigating the face space, e.g. for finding criminals based on a description.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nQuestions:\n- \"Inventing plausible fine details while preserving identity\" -- since identity is created and there is no ground truth, where does the line between \"fine detail\" and \"new identity\" lie?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- Some notation is not defined in the equation on the last page."[[CNT], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
