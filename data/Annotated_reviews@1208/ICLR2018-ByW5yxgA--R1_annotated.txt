"The paper focuses on a very particular HMM structure which involves multiple, independent HMMs.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Each HMM emits an unobserved output with an explicit duration period[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]. This explicit duration modelling captures multiple scales of temporal resolution.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The actual observations are a weighted linear combination of the emissions from each latent HMM.[[RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The structure allows for fast inference using a spectral approach.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nI found the paper unclear and lacking in detail in several key aspects:[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n1. It is unclear to me from Algorithm 2 how the weight vectors w are estimated. This is not adequately explained in the section on estimation.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n2. The authors make the assumption that each HMM injects noise into the unobserved output which then gets propagated into the overall observation.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] What are reasons for his choice of model over a simpler model where the output of each HMM is uncorrupted?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n3. The simulation example does not really demonstrate the ability of the MSHMM to do anything other than recover structure from data simulated under an MSHMM.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] It would be more interesting to apply to data simulated under non-Markovian or other setups that would enable richer frequency structures to be included and the ability of MSHMM to capture these.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n4. The real data experiments shows some improvements in predictive accuracy with fast inference.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-POS,RES-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the authors do not give a sufficiently broad exploration of the representations learnt by the model which allows us to understand the regimes in which the model would be advantageous.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nOverall, the paper presents an interesting approach[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] but the work lacks maturity.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Furthermore, simulation and real data examples to explore the properties and utility of the method are required.
