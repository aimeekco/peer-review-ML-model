"This paper proposed a probabilistic framework for domain adaptation that properly explains why maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods can achieve desirable performances.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  \nHowever, I have the following concerns on novelty.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n1. Although the paper gives some justiification why auto-encoder can work for domain adaptation from perspective of probalistics model, it does not give new formulation or algorithm to handle domain adaptation.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]  At this point, the novelty is weaken.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n2. In the introduction, the authors mentioned \u201climitations of mSDA is that it needs to explicitly form the covariance matrix of input features and then solves a linear system, which can be computationally expensive in high dimensional settings.[[INT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\u201d However, mSDA cannot handle high dimension setting by performing the  reconstruction with a number of  random non-overlapping sub-sets of input features.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It is not clear why mSDA cannot handle time-series data but DAuto can.[[DAT-NEG, MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  DAuto does not consider the sequence/ordering of data either.[[DAT-NEG, MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n3. If my understanding is not wrong, the proposed DAuto is just a simple combination of three losses (i.e. prediction loss, reconstruction loss, domain difference loss).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] As far as I know, this kind of loss is commonly used in most existing methods.
