"There are many language issues rendering the text hard to understand, e.g.,\n-- in the abstract: \"several convolution on graphs architectures\"\n-- in the definitions: \"Let data with N observation\" (no verb, no plural, etc).[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n-- in the computational section: \"Training size is 9924 and testing is 6695. [[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\"\nso part of my negative impression may be pure mis-understanding of what\nthe authors had to say.[[PDI-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] \n\nStill, the authors clearly utilise basic concepts (c.f. \"utilize eigenvector \nbasis of the graph Laplacian to do filtering in the Fourier domain\") in ways\nthat do not seem to have any sensible interpretation whatsoever, even allowing\nfor the mis-understanding due to grammar.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] There are no clear insight, \nno theorems, and an empirical evaluation on an ill-defined problem in \ntime-series forecasting.[[PDI-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] (How does it relate to graphs?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] What is the graph \nin the time series or among the multiple time series?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] How do the authors\nimplement the other graph-related approaches in this problem featuring\ntime series?)[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY,QSN], [GEN]] My impression is hence that the only possible outcome is\n\nrejection.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]"
