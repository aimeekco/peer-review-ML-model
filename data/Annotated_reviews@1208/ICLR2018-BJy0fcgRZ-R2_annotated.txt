"This paper presents a method based on GANs for visualizing how humans represent visual categories.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Authors perform experiments on two datasets: Asian Faces Dataset and ImageNet Large Scale Recognition Challenge dataset.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nPositive aspects:\n+ The idea of using GANs for this goal is smart and interesting[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n+ The results seem interesting too[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Some aspects of the paper are not clear and presentation needs improvement.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- I miss a clearer results comparison with previous methods, like Vondrick et al. 2015.[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nSpecific comments and questions:\n\n-  Figure 1 is not clear.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Authors should clarify how they use the inference network and what the two arrows from this inference network represent.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- Figure 2 is also not clear.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Just the FLD projections of the MCMCP chains are difficult to interpret.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The legend of the figure is too tiny.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The right part of the figure should be better described in the text or in the caption, I don't understand well what this illustrates.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]\n- Regarding to the human experiments with AMT: how do the authors deal with noise on the workers performance?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is any qualification task used?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] What are the instructions given to the workers?[[CNT], [CNT], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- In section 4.2. the authors state \"We also simultaneously learn a corresponding inference network, .... granular human biases captured\".[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [MIN]] This seems interesting[[CNT], [CNT], [APC], [MIN]] but I didn't find any result on that in the paper.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Can you give more details or refer to where in the paper it is discussed/tested?[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- Figure 4 shows \"most interpretable mixture components\".[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  How this \"most interpretable\" were selected?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- In second paragraph Section 4.3, it should be Table 1 instead of Figure 1.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] \n- It would be interesting to see a discussion on why MCMCP Density is better for group 1 and MCMCP Mean is better for group 2.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] To see the confusion matrixes could be useful.[[MET-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nI like this paper.[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] The addressed problem is challenging and the proposed idea seems interesting.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  However, the aspects mentioned make me think the paper needs some improvements to be published.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]
