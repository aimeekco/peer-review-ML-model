"The paper describes some interesting work[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] but for a combination of reasons I think it's more like a workshop-track paper.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nThere is not much that's technically new in the paper-- at least not much that's really understandable.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]   There is some text about a variant of CTC, but it does not explain very clearly what was done or what the motivation was.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nThere are also quite a few misspellings. [[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \nSince the system is presented without any comparisons to alternatives for any of the individual components, it doesn't really shed any light on the significance of the various modeling decisions that were made.[[RWK-NEG,OAL-POS], [IMP-NEG,CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  That limits the value.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nIf rejected from here, it could perhaps be submitted as an ICASSP or Interspeech paper."[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
