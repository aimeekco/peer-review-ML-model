"This paper applies a predictive coding version of the Sigma-Delta encoding scheme to reduce a computational load on a deep learning network.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Whereas neither of these components are new, to my knowledge, nobody has combined all three of them previously.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The paper is generally clearly written and represents a valuable contribution.[[OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The authors may want to consider the following comments:\n\n1. I did not really understand the analogy with STDP in neuroscience because it relies on the assumption that spiking of the post-synaptic neuron encodes the backpropagating error signal.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] I am not aware of any evidence for this.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Given that the authors\u2019 algorithm does not reproduce the sign-flip in the STDP rule I would suggest revise the corresponding part of the paper.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MAJ]] Certainly, the claim in the Discussion \u201cshow these to be equivalent to a form of STDP \u2013 a learning rule first observed in neuroscience.\u201d is inappropriate.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n2.  If the authors\u2019 encoding scheme really works I feel that they could beef up their experimental results to demonstrate its unqualified advantage.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n3. The paper could benefit greatly from better integration with the existing literature.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\na. Sigma-Delta model of spiking neurons has a long history in neuroscience starting with the work of Shin.

(see Figure 5A for the circuit implementing a Predictive Sigma-Delta encoder discussed by you)\n\nb.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] It is more appropriate to refer to encoding a combination of the current value and the increment as a version of predictive coding in signal processing rather than the proportional derivative scheme in control theory because the objective here is encoding, not control.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] Also, predictive coding has been commonly used in neuroscience:\nSrinivasan MV, Laughlin SB, Dubs A (1982) Predictive coding: a fresh view of inhibition in the retina.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 216: 427\u2013459. pmid:6129637[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\nUsing leaky neurons for encoding and decoding is standard, see e.g.:\nBharioke, Arjun, and Dmitri B.
