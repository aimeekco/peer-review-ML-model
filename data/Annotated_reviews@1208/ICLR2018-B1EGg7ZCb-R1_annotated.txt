"\n\nThis paper proposes to use deep reinforcement learning to solve a multiagent coordination task.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In particular, the paper introduces a benchmark domain to model fleet coordination problems as might be encountered in taxi companies.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper does not really introduce new methods, and as such, this paper should be seen more as an application paper.[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,NOV-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] I think that such a paper could have merits if it would really push the boundary of the feasible, but I do not think that is really the case with this paper: the task still seems quite simplistic, and the empirical evaluation is not convincing (limited analysis, weak baselines).[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] As such, I do not really see any real grounds for acceptance.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\nFinally, there are also many other weaknesses. The paper is quite poorly written in places, has poor formatting (citations are incorrect and half a bibtex entry is inlined), and is highly inadequate in its treatment of related work.[[RWK-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] For instance, there are many related papers on:\n\n-taxi fleet management (e.g., work by Pradeep Varakantham)\n \n-coordination in multi-robot systems for spatially distributed tasks (e.g., Gerkey and much work since)\n\n-scaling up multiagent reinforcement learning and multiagent MDPs (Guestrin et al 2002, Kok & Vlassis 2006, etc.)[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n-dealing with partial observability (work on decentralized POMDPs by Peshkin et al, 2000, Bernstein, Amato, etc.)[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n-multiagent deep RL has been very active last 1-2 years. E.g., see other papers by Foerster, Sukhbataar, Omidshafiei[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n\nOverall, I see this as a paper which with improvements could make a nice workshop contribution, but not as a paper to be published at a top-tier venue.\n\n"[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]
