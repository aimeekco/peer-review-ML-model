"This paper studies the control of symmetric linear dynamical systems with unknown dynamics.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Typically this problem is split into a (non-convex) system ID step followed by a derivation of an optimal controller, but there are few guarantees about this combined process.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  This manuscript formulates a convex program of optimal control without the separate system ID step, resulting in provably optimality guarantees and efficient algorithms (in terms of the sample complexity).[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The paper is generally pretty well written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThis paper leans heavily on Hazan 2017 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00946.pdf). [[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]Where the Hazan paper concerns itself with the system id portion of the control problem, this paper seems to be the controls extension of that same approach.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]   From what I can tell, Hazan's paper introduces the idea of wave filtering (convolution of the input with eigenvectors of the Hankel matrix); the filtered output is then passed through another matrix that is being learned online (M).[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] That matrix is then mapped back to system id (A,B,C,D).[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  The most novel contribution of this ICLR paper seems to be equation (4), where the authors set up an optimization problem to solve for optimal inputs; much of that optimization set-up relies on Hazan's work, though.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the authors do prove their work, which increases the novelty.[[OAL-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The novelty would be improved with clearer differentiation from the Hazan 2017 paper.[[RWK-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nMy biggest concerns that dampen my enthusiasm are some assumptions that may not be realistic in most controls settings:\n\n- First, the most concerning assumption is that of a symmetric LDS matrix A (and Lyapunov stability).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]  As far as I know, symmetric LDS models are not common in the controls community.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  From a couple of quick searches it seems like there are a few physics / chemistry applications where a symmetric A makes sense, but the authors don't do a good enough job setting up the context here to make the results compelling.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Without that context it's hard to tell how broadly useful these results are.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]   In Hazan's paper they mention that the system id portion, at least, seems to work with non-symmetric, and even non-linear dynamical systems (bottom of page 3, Hazan 2017).[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Is there any way to extend the current results to non-symmetric systems?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\n- Second, it appears that the proposed methods may rely on running the dynamical system several times before attempting to control it.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Am I misunderstanding something?[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  If so this seems like it may be a significant constraint that would shrink the application space and impact even further.\n"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]
