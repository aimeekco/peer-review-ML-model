"Paper proposes a weak synchronization approach to synchronous SGD with the goal of improving even with slow parameter servers.[[RWK-NEG,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] This is an improvement on earlier proposals (e.g. Revisiting Synchronous SGD) that allow for slow workers.[[RWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Empirical results on ResNet50 on CIFAR show promising results for simulations with slow workers and servers, with the proposed approach.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS,RES-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nIssues with the paper:\n- Since the paper is focused on empirical results, having results only for ResNet50 on CIFAR is very limiting\n- Empirical results are based on simulations and not real workloads.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The choice of simulation constants (% delayed, and delay time) seems somewhat arbitrary as well.[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- For the simulated results, the comparisons seem unfair since the validation error is different[[RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. It will be useful to also provide time to a certain accuracy that all of them get to e.g. the validation error of 0.1609 (reached by the 3 important cases).[[RWK-POS,ANA-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall, the paper proposes an interesting improvement to this area of synchronous training, however it is unable to validate the impact of this proposal."[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
