"This paper presents an algorithm for clustering using DNNs.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The algorithm essentially alternates over two steps: a step that trains the DNN to predict random targets, and another step that reassigns the targets based on the overall matching with the DNN outputs.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The second step also shrinks the number of targets over time to achieve clustering.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Intuitively, the randomness in target may achieve certain regularization effect.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nMy concerns:\n1. There is no analysis on what the regularization effect is.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] What advantage does the proposed algorithm offer to an user that a more deterministic algorithm cannot?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n2. The delete-and-copy step also introduces randomness, and since the algorithm removes targets over time, it is not clear if the algorithm consistently optimizes one objective throughout.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Without a consistent objective function, the algorithm seems somewhat heuristic.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n3. Due to the randomness from multiple operations, the experiments need to be run multiple times, and see if the output clustering is sensitive to it.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] If it turns out the algorithm is quite robust to the randomness, it is then an interesting question why this is the case.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN,DIS], [MIN]]\n4. Does the  Hungarian algorithm used for matching scales to much larger datasets?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n5. While the algorithm empirically improve over k-means,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] I believe at this point combinations of DNN with classical clustering algorithms already exist and comparisons with such stronger baselines are missing. [[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]The authors have listed a few related algorithms in the last paragraph on page 1.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] I think the following one is also relevant:\n-- Law et al.
