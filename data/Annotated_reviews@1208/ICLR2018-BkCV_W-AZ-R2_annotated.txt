"This paper introduces the concepts of counterfactual regret minimization in the field of Deep RL.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Specifically, the authors introduce an algorithm called ARM which can deal with partial observability better.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The results is interesting and novel.[[RES-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  This paper should be accepted.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThe presentation of the paper can be improved a bit.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  Much of the notation introduced in section 3.1 is not used later on.[[CNT], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]  There seems to be a bit of a disconnect before and after section 3.3.[[CNT], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The algorithm in deep RL could be explained a bit better.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThere are some papers that could be connected.[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Notably the distributional RL work that was recently published could be very interesting to compare against in partially observed environments.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nIt could also be interesting if the authors were to run the proposed algorithm on environments where long-term memory is required to achieve the goals.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nThe argument the authors made against recurrent value functions is that recurrent value could be hard to train.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] An experiment illustrating this effect could be illuminating.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nCan the proposed approach help when we have recurrent value functions?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Since recurrence does not guarantee that all information needed is captured.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n\nFinally some miscellaneous points:\n\nOne interesting reference: Memory-based control with recurrent neural\nnetworks by Heess et al.[[BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nPotential typos: in the 4th bullet point in section 3.1, should it be \\rho^{\\pi}(h, s')?"[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
