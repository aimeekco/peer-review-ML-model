"This work proposes a multi task learning framework for the modeling of clinical data in neurodegenerative diseases.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \nDifferently from previous applications of machine learning in neurodegeneration modeling, the proposed approach models the clinical data accounting for the bounded nature of cognitive tests scores.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The framework is represented by a feed-forward deep architecture analogous to a residual network.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] At each layer a low-rank constraint is enforced on the linear transformation, while the cost function is specified in order to differentially account for the bounds of the predicted variables.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe idea of explicitly accounting for the boundedness of clinical scores is interesting,[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] although the assumption of the proposed model is still incorrect: clinical scores are defined on discrete scales.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] For this reason the Gaussian assumption for the cost function used in the method is still not appropriate for the proposed application.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \nFurthermore, while being the main methodological drive of this work, the paper does not show evidence about improved predictive performance and generalisation when accounting for the boundedness of the regression targets.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \nThe proposed algorithm is also generally compared with respect to linear methods, and the authors could have provided a more rigorous benchmark including standard non-linear prediction approaches (e.g. random forests, NN, GP, \u2026).[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nOverall, the proposed methods seems to provide little added value to the large amount of predictive methods proposed so far for prediction in neurodegenerative disorders.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Moreover, the proposed experimental paradigm appears flawed.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] What is the interest of predicting baseline (or 6 months at best) cognitive scores (relatively low-cost and part of any routine clinical assessment) from brain imaging data (high-cost and not routine)?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nOther remarks. \n\n- In section 2.2 and 4 there is some confusion between iteration indices and samples indices \u201ci\u201d.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n- Contrarily to what is stated in the introduction, the loss functions proposed in page 3 (first two formulas) only accounts for the lower bound of the predicted variables.[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n\n-  Figure 2, synthetic data.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The scale of the improvement of the subspace difference is quite tiny, in the order of 1e-2 when compared to U, and of 1e-5 across iterations.[[RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The loss function of Figure 2.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]b also does not show a strong improvement across iterations, while indicating a rather large instability of the optimisation procedure.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] These aspects may be a sign of convergence issues.[[MEt-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n- The dimensionality of the subspace representation importantly depends on the choice of the rank R of U and V.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This is a crucial parameters that is however not discussed nor analysed in the paper.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n- The synthetic example of page 7 is quite misleading and potentially biased towards the proposed model.[[CNT], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The authors are generating the synthetic data according to the model, and it is thus not surprising that they managed to obtain the best performance.[[DAT-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  In particular, due to the nonlinear nature of (1), all the competing linear models are expected to perform poorly in this kind of setting.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n- The computation time for the linear model shown in Table 3 is quite surprising (~20 minutes for linear regression of 5k observations).[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Is there anything that I am missing?\n"[[CNT], [CNT], [QSN], [GEN]]
