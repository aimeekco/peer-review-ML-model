"This paper is an experimental paper.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] It investigates what sort of image representations are good for image captioning systems.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nOverall, the idea seems relevant and there are some good findings but I am sure that image captioning community is already aware of these findings.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe main issue of the paper is the lack of novelty.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Even for an experimental paper, I would argue that novelty in the experimental methodology is an important fact.[[EXP-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Unfortunately, I do not see any novel concept in the experimental setup.[[EXP-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nI recomend this paper for a workshop presentation.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
