"The paper proposes a new neural network based method for recommendation.,[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe main finding of the paper is that a relatively simple method works for recommendation, compared to other methods based on neural networks that have been recently proposed.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThis contribution is not bad for an empirical paper.[[OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] There's certainly not that much here that's groundbreaking methodologically, though it's certainly nice to know that a simple and scalable method works.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThere's not much detail about the data (it is after all an industrial paper).[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It would certainly be helpful to know how well the proposed method performs on a few standard recommender systems benchmark datasets (compared to the same baselines), in order to get a sense as to whether the improvement is actually due to having a better model, versus being due to some unique attributes of this particular industrial dataset under consideration.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] As it is, I am a little concerned that this may be a method that happens to work well for the types of data the authors are considering but may not work elsewhere.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nOther than that, it's nice to see an evaluation on real production data, and it's nice that the authors have provided enough info that the method should be (more or less) reproducible.[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] There's some slight concern that maybe this paper would be better for the industry track of some conference, given that it's focused on an empirical evaluation rather than really making much of a methodological contribution.[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Again, this could be somewhat alleviated by evaluating on some standard and reproducible benchmarks."[[OAL-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
