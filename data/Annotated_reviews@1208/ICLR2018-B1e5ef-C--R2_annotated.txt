"The interesting paper provides theoretical support for the low-dimensional vector embeddings computed using LSTMs or simple techniques, using tools from compressed sensing.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The paper also provides numerical results to support their theoretical findings.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The paper is well presented and organized.[[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\n-In theorem 4.1, the embedding dimension $d$ is depending on $T^2$, and it may scale poorly with respect to $T$."[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
