"The quality of the paper is good, and clarity is mostly good.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The proposed metric is interesting,;[[MET-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] but it is hard to judge the significance without more thorough experiments demonstrating that it works in practice.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nPros:\n - clear definitions of terms\n - overall outline of paper is good\n - novel metric.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons\n - text is a bit over-wordy, and flow/meaning sometimes get lost.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] A strict editor would be helpful, because the underlying content is good\n - odd that your definition of generalization in GANs appears immediately preceding the section titled \"Generalisation in GANs\"\n - the paragraph at the end of the \"Generalisation in GANs\" section is confusing.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [SUG], [MAJ]] I think this section and the previous (\"The objective of unsupervised learning\") could be combined, removing some repetition, adding some subtitles to improve clarity.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] This would cut down the text a bit to make space for more experiments.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n - why is your definition of generalization that the test set distance is strictly less than training set ?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] I would think this should be less-than-or-equal[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n - there is a sentence that doesn't end at the top of p.3: \"... the original GAN paper showed that [ends here].[[RWK-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\"\n - should state in the abstract what your \"notion of generalization\" for gans is, instead of being vague about it.[[ABS-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n - more experiments showing a comparison of the proposed metric to others (e.g. inception score, Mturk assessments of sample quality, etc.) would be necessary to find the metric convincing[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n - what is a \"pushforward measure\"?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] (p.2)\n - the related work section is well-written and interesting, but it's a bit odd to have it at the end.[[RWK-POS], [PNF-NEG], [APC], [MAJ]] Earlier in the work (e.g. before experiments and discussion) would allow the comparison with MMD to inform the context of the introduction.[[INT-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n - there are some errors in figures that I think were all mentioned by previous commentators.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]"
