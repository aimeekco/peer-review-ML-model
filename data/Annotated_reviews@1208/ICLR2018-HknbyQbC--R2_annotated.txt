"This paper describes AdvGAN, a conditional GAN plus adversarial loss.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] AdvGAN is able to generate adversarial samples by running a forward pass on generator.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors evaluate AdvGAN on semi-white box and black box setting.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nAdvGAN is a simple and neat solution to for generating adversary samples.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The author also reports state-of-art results.[[PDI-POS,RES-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nComment:\n\n1. For MNIST samples, we can easily find the generated sample is a mixture of two digitals. Eg, for digital 7 there is a light gray 3 overlap. [[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]I am wondering this method is trying to mixture several samples into one to generate adversary samples.[[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEU,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] For real color samples, it is harder to figure out the mixture.[[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]]\n2. Based on mixture assumption, I suggest the author add one more comparison to other method,[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,REC-NEG], [DFT,FBK], [MIN]] which is relative change from original image, to see whether AdvGAN is the most efficient model to generate the adversary sample (makes minimal change to original image).\n\n\n\n"[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,REC-NEU], [DIS,FBK], [GEN]]
