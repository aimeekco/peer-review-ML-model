"This paper proposes to disentangle attributes by forcing a representation where individual components of this representation account for individual attributes.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nPros: \n+ The idea of forcing different parts of the latent representation to be responsible for different attributes appears novel.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n+ A theoretical guarantee of the efficiency of an aspect of the proposed method is given.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nCons: \n- The results are not very appealing visually. [[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]The results from the proposed method do not seem much better than the baselines.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]What is the objective for the images in Fig. 4? [[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]For example I'm looking at the bottom right, and that image looks more like a merger of images, than a modification of the image in the top-left but adding the attributes of choice.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- Quantitative results are missing.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] \n- Some unclarity in the description of the method; see below.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nQuestions/other:\n- What is meant by \"implicit\" models?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] By \"do not anchor a specific meaning into the disentanglement\"?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] By \"circumscribed in two image domains\"?[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  \n- Why does the method require two images?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n- In the case of images, what is a dominant vs recessive pattern?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n- It seems artificial to enforce that \"the attribute-irrelevant part [should] encode some information of images\".[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n- Why are (1, 0) and (1, 1) not useful pairs?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- Need to be more specific: \"use some channels to encode the id information\". \n"[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
