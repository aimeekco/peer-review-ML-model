"The paper proposes a neural network architecture for centralized and decentralized settings in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) which is trainable with policy gradients.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\nAuthors experiment with the proposed architecture on a set of synthetic toy tasks and a few Starcraft combat levels, where they find their approach to perform better than baselines.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nOverall, I had a very confusing feeling when reading the paper.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\u2028First, authors do not formulate what exactly is the problem statement for MARL.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Is it an MDP or poMDP? [[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]How do different agents perceive their time, is it synchronized or not?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] Do they (partially) share the incentive or may have completely arbitrary rewards?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\nWhat is exactly the communication protocol?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nI find this question especially important for MARL, because the assumption on synchronous and noise-free communication, including gradients is too strong to be useful in many practical tasks.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nSecond, even though the proposed architecture proved to perform empirically better that the considered baselines, the extent to which it advances RL research is unclear to me.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nCurrently, it looks \n\nBased on that, I can\u2019t recommend acceptance of the paper.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\nTo make the paper stronger and justify importance of the proposed architecture, I suggest authors to consider relaxing assumptions on the communication protocol to allow delayed and/or noisy communication (including gradients).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\nIt would be also interesting to see if the network somehow learns an implicit global state representation used for planning and how is the developed plan changed when new information from one of the slave agents arrives."[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
