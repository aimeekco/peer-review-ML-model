"This is a fine paper that generally reads as a new episode in a series on motion-based video prediction with an eye towards robotic manipulation [Finn et al. 2016, Finn and Levine 2017, Ebert et al. 2017].[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The work is rather incremental but is competently executed.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] It is in line with current trends in the research community and is a good fit for ICLR.[[OAL-POS], [APR-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The paper is well-written, reasonably scholarly, and contains stimulating insights.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nI recommend acceptance, despite some reservations.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]] My chief criticism is a matter of research style: instead of this deluge of barely distinguishable least-publishable-unit papers on the same topic, in every single conference, I wish the authors didn\u2019t slice so thinly, devoted more time to each paper, and served up a more substantial dish.[[OAL-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nSome more detailed comments:\n\n- The argument for evaluating visual realism never quite gels and is not convincing.[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The paper advocates two primary metrics: accuracy of the predicted motion and perceptual realism of the synthesized images.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The argument for motion accuracy is clear and is clearly stated: it\u2019s the measure that is actually tied to the intended application, which is using action-conditional motion prediction for control.[[PDI-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] A corresponding argument for perceptual realism is missing.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  Indeed, a skeptical reviewer may suspect that the authors needed to add perceptual realism to the evaluation because that\u2019s the only thing that justifies the adversarial loss.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]  The adversarial loss is presented as the central conceptual contribution of the paper, but doesn\u2019t actually make a difference in terms of task-relevant metrics.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  A skeptical perspective on the paper is that the adversarial loss just makes the images look prettier but makes no difference in terms of task performance (control).[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  This is an informative negative result.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  It's not how the paper is written, though. [[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\n- The \u201cno adversary\u201d/\u201cno adv\u201d condition in Table 1 and Figure 4 is misleading.[[TNF-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [MIN]]  It\u2019s not properly controlled.[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  It is not the case that the adversarial loss was simply removed.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  The regression loss was also changed from l_1 to l_2.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This is not right.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The motivation for this control is to evaluate the impact of the adversarial loss, which is presented as the key conceptual contribution of the paper.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] It should be a proper control.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  The other loss should remain what it is in the full \u201cOurs\u201d condition (i.e., l_1).[[CNT], [CNT], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\n- The last sentence in the caption of Table 1 -- \u201cSlight improvement in motion is observed by training with an adversary as well\u201d -- should be removed.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  The improvement is in the noise.[[TNF-NEU], [CNT], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\n- Generally, the quantitative impact of the adversarial loss never comes together. The only statistically significant improvement is on perceptual image realism.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] The relevance of perceptual image realism to the intended task (control) is not substantiated, as discussed earlier.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n- In the perceptual evaluation procedure, the \u201c1 second\u201d restriction is artificial and makes the evaluated methods appear better than they are.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] If we are serious about evaluating image realism and working towards passing the visual Turing test, we should report results without an artificial time limit.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] They won\u2019t look as flattering, but will properly report our progress on this journey.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]] If desired, the results of timed comparisons can also be reported, but reporting just a timed comparison with an artificial limit of 1 second may mislead some readers into thinking that we are farther along than we actually are.[[RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n\nThere are some broken sentences that mar an otherwise well-written paper:\n\n- End of Section 1, \u201cproducing use a learned discriminator and show improvements in visual quality\u201d[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n- Beginning of Section 3, \u201cWe first present the our overall network architecture\u201d\n\n- page 4, \u201cto choose to copy pixels from the previous frame, used transformed versions of the previous frame\u201d[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n- page 4, \u201cconvolving in the input image with\u201d\n\n- page 5, \u201cis know to produce\u201d\n\n- page 5, \u201can additional indicating\u201d[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n- page 5, \u201cAdam Kingma & Ba (2015)\u201d (use the other cite command)\n\n- page 5, \u201cwe observes\u201d\n\n- page 5, \u201csmaller batch sizes degrades\u201d\n\n- page 5, \u201clarger batch sizes provides\u201d\n"[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
