"The main contribution of this paper are:\n(a) replacing the typical maximum likelihood criterion in neural language model training with a discriminative criterion,[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n(b) propose two large margin criterion -- difference in likelihood and difference in rank (WER or BLUE ordered) hypotheses,[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n(c) demonstrate performance gains two standard tasks -- an ASR task on Wall Street Journal (small task) and an MT task.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nIn addition, they provide examples in Figure (1) and (2) that illustrate the effect of the cost function on training.[[TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Their illustration in Figure 4 is also helpful in seeing the impact of using a warm start with a generative model.\n"[[TNF-POS,RES-POS], [PNF-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
