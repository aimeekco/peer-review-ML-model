"This paper proposes one RL architecture using external memory for previous states, with the purpose of solving the non-markov tasks.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The essential problems here are how to identify which states should be stored and how to retrieve memory during action prediction.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed architecture could identify the \u2018key\u2019 states through assigning higher weights for important states, and applied reservoir sampling to control write and read on memory.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The weight assigning (write) network is optimized for maximize the expected rewards.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This article focuses on the calculation of gradient for write network, and provides some mathematical clues for that.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThis article compares their proposed architecture with RNN (GRU with 10 hidden unit) in few toy tasks.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] They demonstrate that proposed model could work better and rational of write network could be observed.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] However, it seems that hyper-parameters for RNN haven\u2019t been tuned enough.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] It is because the toy task author demonstrates is actually quite similar to copy tasks, that previous state should be remembered.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] To my knowledge, copy task could be solved easily for super long sequence through RNN model.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Therefore, empirically, it is really hard to justify whether this proposed method could work better.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Also, intuitively, this episodic memory method should work better on long-term dependencies task, while this article only shows the task with 10 timesteps.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] \n\nAccording to that, the experiments they demonstrated in this article are not well designed so that the conclusion they made in this article is not robust enough.
