"This paper proposes MaskGAN, a GAN-based generative model of text based on\nthe idea of recovery from masked text.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \nFor this purpose, authors employed a reinceforcement learning approach to\noptize a prediction from masked text.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Moreover, authors argue that the \nquality of generated texts is not appropriately measured by perplexities,\nthus using another criterion of a diversity of generated n-grams as well as\nqualitative evaluations by examples and by humans.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nWhile basically the approach seems plausible, the issue is that the result is\nnot compared to ordinary LSTM-based baselines.[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [APC], [MAJ]] While it is better than a \nconterpart of MLE (MaskedMLE), whether the result is qualitatively better than\nordinary LSTM is still in question.[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nIn fact, this is already appearent both from the model architectures and the\ngenerated examples: because the model aims to fill-in blanks from the text\naround (up to that time), generated texts are generally locally valid but not\nalways valid globally. This issue is also pointed out by authors in Appendix\nA.2.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [SMY], [MAJ]] \nWhile the idea of using mask is interesting and important, I think if this\nidea could be implemented in another way, because it resembles Gibbs sampling\nwhere each token is sampled from its sorrounding context, while its objective\nis still global, sentence-wise.[[PDI-POS,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] As argued in Section 1, the ability of \nobtaining signals token-wise looks beneficial at first, but it will actually\nbreak a global validity of syntax and other sentence-wise phenoma.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nBased on the arguments above, I think this paper is valuable at least\nconceptually, but doubt if it is actually usable in place of ordinary LSTM\n(or RNN)-based generation.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\nMore arguments are desirable for the advantage of this paper, i.e. quantitative\nevaluation of diversity of generated text as opposed to LSTM-based methods.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n*Based on the rebuttals and thorough experimental results, I modified the global rating.[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]"
