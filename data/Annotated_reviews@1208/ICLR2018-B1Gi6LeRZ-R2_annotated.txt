"This manuscript proposes a method to improve the performance of a generic learning method by generating \"in between class\" (BC) training samples.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The manuscript motivates the necessity of such technique and presents the basic intuition.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors show how the so-called BC learning helps training different deep architectures for the sound recognition task.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nMy first remark regards the presentation of the technique.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] The authors argue that it is not a data augmentation technique, but rather a learning method.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] I strongly disagree with this statement, not only because the technique deals exactly with augmenting data, but also because it can be used in combination to any learning method (including non-deep learning methodologies).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Naturally, the literature review deals with data augmentation technique, which supports my point of view.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn this regard, I would have expected comparison with other state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The usefulness of the BC technique is proven to a certain extent (see paragraph below) but there is not comparison with state-of-the-art.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] In other words, the authors do not compare the proposed method with other methods doing data augmentation.[[MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] This is crucial to understand the advantages of the BC technique.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThere is a more fundamental question for which I was not able to find an explicit answer in the manuscript.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Intuitively, the diagram shown in Figure 4 works well for 3 classes in dimension 2.[[TNF-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] If we add another class, no matter how do we define the borders, there will be one pair of classes for which the transition from one to another will pass through the region of a third class.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] The situation worsens with more classes.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] However, this can be solved by adding one dimension, 4 classes and 3 dimensions seems something feasible.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] One can easily understand that if there is one more class than the number of dimensions, the assumption should be feasible, but beyond it starts to get problematic.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This discussion does not appear at all in the manuscript and it would be an important limitation of the method, specially when dealing with large-scale data sets.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall I believe the paper is not mature enough for publication.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\nSome minor comments:\n- 2.1: We introduce --> We discussion\n- Pieczak 2015a did not propose the extraction of MFCC.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- the x_i and t_i of section 3.2.2 should not be denoted with the same letters as in 3.2.1.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n- The correspondence with a semantic feature space is too pretentious, specially since no experiment in this direction is shown.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- I understand that there is no mixing in the test phase, perhaps it would be useful to recall it."[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
