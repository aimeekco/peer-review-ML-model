"This study proposes the use of non-negative matrix factorization accounting for baseline by subtracting the pre-stimulus baseline from each trial and subsequently decompose the data using a 3-way factorization thereby identifying spatial and temporal modules as well as their signed activation.[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The method is used on data recorded from mouse and pig retinal ganglion cells of time binned spike trains providing improved performance over non-baseline corrected data.[[RWK-POS,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [SMY,APC], [MIN]] \n\nPros:\nThe paper is well written, the analysis interesting and the application of the Tucker2 framework sound.[[MET-POS,ANA-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Removing baseline is a reasonable step and the paper includes analysis of several spike-train datasets.[[DAT-POS,EXP-POS,ANA-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The analysis of the approaches in terms of their ability to decode is also sound and interesting.[[ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\nI find the novelty of the paper limited: \nThe authors extend the work by (Onken et al. 2016) to subtract baseline (a rather marginal innovation) of this approach. [[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]To use a semi-NMF type of update rule (as proposed by Ding et al .2010) and apply the approach to new spike-train datasets evaluating performance by their decoding ability (decoding also considered in Onken et al. 2016).\n\n[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEU,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]Multiplicative update-rules are known to suffer from slow-convergence and I would suspect this also to be an issue for the semi-NMF update rules.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It would therefore be relevant and quite easy to consider other approaches such as active set or column wise updating also denoted HALS which admit negative values in the optimization, see also the review by N.
