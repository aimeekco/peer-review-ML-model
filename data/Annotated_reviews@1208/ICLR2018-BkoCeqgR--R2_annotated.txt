"The authors investigate a modified input layer that results in color invariant networks.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed methods are evaluated on two car datasets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It is shown that certain color invariant \"input\" layers can improve accuracy for test-images from a different color distribution than the training images.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n\nThe proposed assumptions are not well motivated and seem arbitrary.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Why is using a permutation of each pixels' color a good idea?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThe paper is very hard to read.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The message is unclear and the experiments to prove it are of very limited scope,;[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] i.e. one small dataset with the only experiment purportedly showing generalization to red cars.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nSome examples of specific issues:\n- the abstract is almost incomprehensible and it is not clear what the contributions are[[ABS-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- Some references to Figures are missing the figure number, eg. 3.2 first paragraph,[[TNF-NEG,BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] \n- It is not clear how many input channels the color invariant functions use, eg. p1 does it use only one channel and hence has fewer parameters?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- are the training and testing sets all disjoint (sec 4.3)?\n- at random points figures are put in the appendix, even though they are described in the paper and seem to show key results (eg \"tested on nored-test\")[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- Sec 4.6: The explanation for why the accuracy drops for all models is not clear.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Is it because the total number of training images drops?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] If that's the case the whole experimental setup seems flawed.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- Sec 4.6: the authors refer to the \"order net\" beating the baseline, however, from Fig 8 (right most) it appears as if all models beat the baseline.[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MAJ]] In the conclusion they say that weighted order net beats the baseline on all three test sets w/o red cars in the training set. [[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]]Is that Fig 8 @0%?[[TNF-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] The baseline seems to be best performing on \"all cars\" and \"non-red cars\"\n\nIn order to be at an appropriate level for any publication the experiments need to be much more general in scope.\n"[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
