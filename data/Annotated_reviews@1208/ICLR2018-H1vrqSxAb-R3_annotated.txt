"The paper presents a series of empirical studies of the generalization ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to image recognition tasks related to shape images. [[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper makes a number of observations about the learning or transfer learning of shape bias vs. color by controlling and manipulating the input of training data based on shapes, negative shapes, and random images.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]   A concluding observation is that CNN models learn and generalize the structure content of images.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe work is described in sufficient detail including the experimental setups, data set, neural networks, and results.[[DAT-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [SUB-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The experiments should be reproducible given the descriptions in the paper.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nThe overall significance of the results is not very strong since the paper focuses solely on experiments conducted on very limited data and artificially manipulated data.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [IMP-NEG,SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]  It is not clear how the observations made from the experiments generalize beyond these specific learning tasks or how one may take advantage of them in practice.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nOne way to greatly improve the impact of the paper would be to take the observations made from the simulated data experiments (e.g., MNIST) and use them to make changes to how CNN training is done on another real task (e.g., ImageNet) and show improvements in performance."[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
