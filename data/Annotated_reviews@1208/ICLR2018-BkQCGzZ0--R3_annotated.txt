"The authors describe a method for encoding text into a discrete representation / latent space[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]. On a measure that they propose, they should it outperforms an alternative Gumbel-Softmax method for both language modeling and NMT.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe proposed method seems effective, and the proposed DSAE metric is nice, though it\u2019s surprising if previous papers have not used metrics similar to normalized reduction in log-ppl[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]. The datasets considered in the experiments are also large, another plus.[[DAT-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] However, overall, the paper is difficult to read and parse, especially since low-level details are weaved together with higher-level points throughout, and are often not motivated.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe major critique would be the qualitative nature of results in the sections on \u201cDecipering the latent code\u201d and (to a lesser extent) \u201cMixed sample-beam decoding.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]]\u201d These two sections are simply too anecdotal, although it is nice being stepped through the reasoning for the single example considered in Section 3.3.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC,DIS], [MIN]] Some quantitative or aggregate results are needed, and it should at least be straightforward to do so using human evaluation for a subset of examples for diverse decoding.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n"
