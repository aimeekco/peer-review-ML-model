"This paper proposes a method to automatically tuning the momentum parameter in momentum SGD methods, which achieves better results and fast convergence speed than state-of-the-art Adam algorithm.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nAlthough the results are promising,[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I found the presentation of this paper almost inaccessible to me.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nFirst, though a minor point, but where does the name *YellowFin* come from?[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nFor the presentation, the motivation in introduction is fine,[[INT-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MIN]] but the following section about momentum operator is hard to follow.[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] There are a lot of undefined notation.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, what does the *convergence rate* mean (what is the measurement for convergence)?[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] And is the *optimal accelerated rate* the same as *convergence rate* mentioned above?[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] Also, what do you mean by *all directions* in the sentence below eq.2?[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThen the paper talks about robustness properties of the momentum operator.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [MIN]] But: first, I am not sure why the derivative of f(x) is defined as in eq.3, how is that related to the original definition of derivative?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nIn the following paragraph, what is *contraction*?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] Does it have anything to do with the paper as I didn't see it in the remaining text?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nLemma 2 seems to use the spectral radius of the momentum operator as the *robustness*.[[EXP-NEU, MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] But how can it describe the robustness?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] More details are needed to understand this.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nWhat it comes to Section 3, it seems to me that the authors try to use a local quadratic approximation for the original function f(x), and use the results in last section to find the optimal momentum parameter.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] I got confused in this section because eq.9 defines f(x) as a quadratic function.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Is this f(x) the original function (non quadratic) or just the local quadratic approximation?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] If it is the local quadratic approximation, how is it correlated to the original function?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] It seems to me that the authors try to say if h and C are calculated from the original function, then this f(x) is a local quadratic approximation?[[EXP-NEU, MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] If what I think is correct, I think it would be important to show this.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nAlso, the objective function in SingleStep algorithm seems to come from eq.13, but I failed to get the exact reasoning.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting paper,[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] but the presentation is too fuzzy to get it evaluated."[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
