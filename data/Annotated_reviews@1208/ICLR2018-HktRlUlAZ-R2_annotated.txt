"This paper proposes a method to learn networks invariant to translation and equivariant to rotation and scale of arbitrary precision.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The idea is to jointly train[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- a network predicting a polar origin,[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- a module transforming the image into a log-polar representation according to the predicted origin,[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- a final classifier performing the desired classification task.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nA (not too large) translation of the input image therefore does not change the log-polar representation.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\nRotation and scale from the polar origin result in translation of the log-polar representation.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] As convolutions are translation equivariant, the final classifier becomes rotation and scale equivariant in terms of the input image.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Rotation and scale can have arbitrary precision, which is novel to the best of my knowledge.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n(+) In my opinion, this is a simple, attractive approach to rotation and scale equivariant CNNs.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n(-) The evaluation, however, is quite limited.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] The approach is evaluated on:\n 1) several variants of MNIST.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The authors introduce a new variant (SIM2MNIST), which is created by applying random similitudes to the images from MNIST.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] This variant is of course very well suited to the proposed method, and a bit artificial.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n 2) 3d voxel occupancy grids with a small resolution.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  The objects can be rotated around the z-axis, and the method is used to be equivariant to this rotation.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  \n\n(-) Since the method starts by predicting the polar origin, wouldn't it be possible to also predict rotation and scale?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]   Then the input image could be rectified to a canonical orientation and scale, without needing equivariance.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]   My intuition is that this simpler approach would work better.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]   It should at least be evaluated.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  \n\nDespite these weaknesses, I think this paper should be interesting for researchers looking into equivariant CNNs.\n"[[FWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
