"This paper try to analyze the intrinsic structure of VGG19 and give a new insight of deep neural networks.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors propose to use SVD tools to estimate the dimension of the deep manifolds, and conduct experiments on three categories of ImageNet.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The papers are written well and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The analysis of manifold structure of DNN is important direction, but I am afraid novelty and insight of this work is not enough for acceptance.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG], [CRT,FBK], [MAJ]]\npros:\n 1. The paper is well written and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n 2. Manifold analysis of the intrinsic structure of DNN is a important direction for further study.[[EXT-NEU], [CNT], [DIS], [GEN]]\ncons:\n 1. SVD is a standard tool for subspace and manifold analysis for decades of years.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] I do not think using it in DNN is a big contribution.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n2. The authors should explain why choosing VGG19 for analysis.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Do other deep neural networks, such as Resnet, Googlenet, can  have the same phenomenon?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n3. Why the authors choose Persian Cat, Container Ship, and Volcano in the experiments?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Do other categories have the similar results?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n4. The authors can indicate the application scenario of this work.[[FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] For example, this work may guide to design better CNN structure for higher accuracy and lower computation cost.[[ANA-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] It may help the readers better understand the values of this work.\n    "[[OAL-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
