"The basic idea is to train a neural network to predict various hyperparameters of a classifier from input-output pairs for that classifier (kennen-o approach).[[PDI-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]] It is surprising that some of these hyperparameters can even be predicted with more than chance accuracy.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SMY], [MAJ]] As a simple example, it's possible that there are values of batch size for which the classifiers may become indistinguishable,[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] yet Table 2 shows that batch size can be predicted with much higher accuracy than chance[[DAT-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]]. It would be good to provide insights into under what conditions and why hyperparameters can be predicted accurately[[MET-NEU], [EMP-POS], [SUG], [MIN]]. That would make the results much more interesting, and may even turn out to be useful for other problems, such as hyperparameter optimization[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [SUG], [MIN]].\n\nThe selection of the queries for kennen-o is not explained. What is the procedure for selecting the queries? How sensitive is the performance of kennen-o to the choice of the queries?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] One would expect that there is significant sensitivity, in which case it may even make sense to consider learning to select a sequence of queries to maximize accuracy.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nIn table 3, it would be useful to show the results for kennen-o as well, because Split-E seems to be the more realistic problem setting and kennen-o seems to be a more realistic attack than kennen-i or kennen-io.[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nIn the ImageNet classifier family prediction, how different are the various families from each other?[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Without going through all the references, it is difficult to get a sense of the difficulty of the prediction task for a non-computer-vision reader.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nOverall the results seem interesting,[[RES-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] but without more insights it's difficult to judge how generally useful they are.[[OAL-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]
