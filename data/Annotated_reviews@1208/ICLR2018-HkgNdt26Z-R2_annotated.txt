"my main concern is the relevance of this paper to ICLR.[[EXT-NEU], [CNT], [CNT], [CNT]]\nThis paper is much related not to representation learning but to user-interface.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nThe paper is NOT well organized and so the technical novelty of the method is unclear.[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,NOV-NEG,PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\nFor example, the existing method and proposed method seems to be mixed in Section 2.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\nYou should clearly divide the existing study and your work.[[RWK-NEG], [null], [SUG,CRT], [GEN]] \nThe experimental setting is also unclear.[[EXP-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\nKSS seems to need the user study.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]\nBut I do not catch the details of the user study, e.g., the number of users.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]\n"
