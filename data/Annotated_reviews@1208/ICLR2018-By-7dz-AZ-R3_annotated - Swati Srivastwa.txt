"The authors consider the metrics for evaluating disentangled representations.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They define three criteria: Disentanglement, Informativeness, and Completeness.[[INT-NEU],  [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They  learning a linear mapping from the latent code to an idealized set of disentangled generative factors, and then define information-theoretic measures based on pseudo-distributions calculated from the relative magnitudes of weights.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experimental evaluation considers a dataset of 200k images of a teapot with varying pose and color.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nI think that defining metrics for evaluating the degree of disentanglement in representations is  great problem to look at.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Overall, the metrics approached by the authors are reasonable, though the way pseudo-distribution are define in terms of normalized weight magnitudes is seems a little ad hoc to me.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  \n\nA second limitation of the work is the reliance on a \"true\" set of disentangled factors.[[CNT], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] We generally want to learn learning disentangled representations in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner, which means that we will in general not have access supervision data for the disentangled factors.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Could the authors perhaps comment on how well these metrics would work in the semi-supervised case?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nOverall, I would say this is somewhat borderline, but I could be convinced to argue for acceptance based on the other reviews and the author response.[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]] \n\nMinor Commments:\n\n- Tables 1 and 2 would be easier to unpack if the authors were to list the names of the variables (i.e. azimuth instead of z_0) or at least list what each variable is in the caption.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n- It is not entirely clear to me how the proposed metrics, whose definitions all reference magnitudes of weights, generalize to the case of random forests.
