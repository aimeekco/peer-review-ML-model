"The paper aims to address a common issue in many classification applications: that the number of training data from different classes is much unbalanced.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper proposes a Bayesian framework to address it with a Gaussian mixture model.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nOverall the math looks reasonable.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] I am not sure about the novelty of the paper, as it is a relatively standard definition of Bayesian math.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU,CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Essentially, instead of computing a softmax prediction which is the discrimination probability of each class given the input, one uses a logistic regression type interpretation (equation 1).[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [MIN]] This has been used in multi-class classification before.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] For example, many early SVM papers deal with multi-class classification by training 1-vs-all classifiers on each class and then choose the one having the highest score (possibly with a class-prior adjustment).\[[RWK-NEU,EXT-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]n\nNote that this actually changes the underlying assumption a bit: softmax basically assumes the classes are mutually exclusive, while this interpretation implicitly assumes that the classes are not related to each other - an image could belong to multiple classes.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This probably does not match the assumption of many of the datasets being tested upon (CIFAR, MNIST) but I don't consider that a fundamental issue.[[DAT-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nI am quite a bit concerned about the experimentation protocol as well.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The datasets are relatively smaller scale, and datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR are known to overfit.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] As a result, although there are approaches taken to generate unbalanced datasets out of them (e.g. MNIST).[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Regardless, the results seem to suggest that the proposed method is similar to softmax performance - which is expected as they are similar - but I am not sure if it accurately evaluated / analyzed the possible application and performance gain of the proposed method."[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
