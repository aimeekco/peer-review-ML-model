"The authors develop a novel scheme for backpropagating on the adjacency matrix of a neural network graph.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  Using this scheme, they are able to provide a little bit of evidence that their scheme allows for higher test accuracy when learning a new graph structure on a couple different example problems.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nPros: \n-Authors provide some empirical evidence for the benefits of using their technique.[[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n-Authors are fairly upfront about how, overall, it seems their technique isn't doing *too* much--null results are still results, and it would be interesting to better understand *why* learning a better graph for these networks doesn't help very much.[[PDI-NEG,RES-NEG,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nCons: \n-The grammar in the paper is pretty bad.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [GEN]]  It could use a couple more passes with an editor.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n-For a, more or less, entirely empirical paper, the choices of experiments are...somewhat befuddling.[[EXP-NEG,OAL-NEU], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]  Considerably more details on implementation, training time/test time, and even just *more* experiment domains would do this paper a tremendous amount of good.[[EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n-While I mentioned it as a pro, it also seems to be that this technique simply doesn't buy you very much as a practitioner.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]  If this is true--that learning better graph representations really doesn't help very much, that would be good to know, and publishable, but actually *establishing* that requires considerably more experiments.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nUltimately, I will have to suggest rejection, unless the authors considerably beef up their manuscript with more experiments, more details, and improve the grammar considerably.[[EXP-NEG,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,REC-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n"
