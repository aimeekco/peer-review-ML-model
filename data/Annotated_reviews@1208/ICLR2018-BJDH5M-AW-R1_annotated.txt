"Summary: This work proposes a way to create 3D objects to fool the classification of their pictures from different view points by a neural network.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nRather than optimizing the log-likelihood of a single example, the optimization if performed over a the expectation of a set of transformations of sample images.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Using an inception v3 net, they create adversarial attacks on a subset of the imagenet validation set transformed by translations, lightening conditions, rotations, and scalings among others, and observe a drop of the classifier accuracy performance from 70% to less than 1%.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They also create two 3D printed objects which most pictures taken from random viewpoints are fooling the network in its class prediction.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n \n\nMain comments:\n- The idea of building 3D adversarial objects is novel so the study is interesting.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the paper is incomplete, with a very low number of references, only 2 conference papers if we assume the list is up to date.[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \nSee for instance Cisse et al. Houdini: fooling Deep Structured Prediction Models, NIPS 2017 for a recent list of related work in this research area.[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n- The presentation of the results is not very clear.[[RES-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  See specific comments below.\n- It would be nice to include insights to improve neural nets to become less sensitive to these attacks.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] \n\n\nMinor comments:\nFig1 : a bug with color seems to have been fixed\nModel section: be consistent with the notations.[[RES-POS], [EMP-NEG], [APC], [MIN]]  Bold everywhere or nowhere[[RES-POS], [EMP-NEG], [APC], [MIN]]\nResults: The tables are difficult to read and should be clarified:[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nWhat does the l2 metric stands for ?
