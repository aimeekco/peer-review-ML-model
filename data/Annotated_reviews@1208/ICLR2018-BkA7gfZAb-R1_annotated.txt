"The paper deals with \u201cfixing GANs at the computational level\u201d, in a similar sprit to f-GANs and WGANs. [[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]The fix is very specific and restricted.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It relies on the logistic regression model as the discriminator, and the dual formulation of logistic regression by Jaakkola and Haussler.[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nComments: \n1) Experiments are performed by restricting alternatives to also use a linear classifier for the discriminator.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] It is mentioned that results are expected to be lower than those produced by methods with a multi-layer classifier as the discriminator (e.g. Shen et al., Wasserstein distance guided representation learning for domain adaptation, Ganin et al., Domain-adversarial training of neural networks?).[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMp-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n2) Considering this is an unsupervised domain adaption problem, how do you set the hyper-parameters lambda and the kernel width?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] The \u201creverse validation\u201d method described in Ganin et al., Domain-adversarial training of neural networks, JMLR, 2016 might be helpful.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]] \n\nMinor comments: on the upper-bound of the distance, alpha_i instead of alpha^\\top, and please label the axes in your figures.
