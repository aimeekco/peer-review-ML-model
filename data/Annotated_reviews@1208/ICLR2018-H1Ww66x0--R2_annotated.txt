"Summary: The paper proposed a two-dimensional approach to lifelong learning, in the context of multi-task learning.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It receives instances in an online setting, where both the prediction model and the relationship between the tasks are learnt using a online kernel based approach.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It also proposed to use budgeting techniques to overcome computational costs.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In general, the paper is poorly written, with many notation mistakes and inconsistencies.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The idea does not seem to be novel, technical novelty is low, and the execution in experiments does not seem to be reliable.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [NOV-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nQuality: No obvious mistakes in the proposed method, but has very low novelty (as most methods follows existing studies in especially for online kernel learning).[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Many mistakes in the presentation and experiments.[[EXP-NEG,OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  \n\nOriginality: The ideas do not seem to be novel, and are mostly (trivially) using existing work as different components of the proposed technique.[[PDI-NEG,RWK-NEU], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n\nClarity: The paper makes many mistakes, and is difficult to read. [N] is elsewhere denoted as \\mathbb{N}.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  The main equation of Algorithm 2 merges into Algorithm 3.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  Many claims are made without justification (e.g. 2.2. \u201cCavallanti 2012 is not suitable for lifelong learning\u201d\u2026 why?; \u201csimple removal scheme \u2026 highest confidence\u201d \u2013 what is the meaning of highest confidence?), etc.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,QSN], [MAJ]]  The removal strategy is not at all well explained \u2013 the objective function details and solving it are not discussed.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  \n\nSignificance: There is no theoretical guarantee on the performance, despite the author\u2019s claiming this as a goal in the introduction itself (\u201cgoal of lifelong learner \u2026 computation\u201d).[[INT-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The experiments are not reliable.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Perceptron obtains a better performance than PA algorithms \u2013 which is very odd.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Moreover, many of the multi-task baselines obtain a worse performance than a simple perceptron (which does not account for multi-task relationships). \n"[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]
