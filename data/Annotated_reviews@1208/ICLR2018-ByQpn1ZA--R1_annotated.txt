"The submission describes an empirical study regarding the training performance\nof GANs; more specifically, it aims to present empirical evidence that the\ntheory of divergence minimization is more a tool to understand the outcome of\ntraining (i.e. Nash equillibrium) than a necessary condition to be enforce\nduring training itself[[INT-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]].\n\nThe work focuses on studying \"non-saturating\" GANs, using the modified generator\nobjective function proposed by Goodfellow et al. in their seminal GAN paper, and\naims to show increased capabilities of this variant, compared to the \"standard\"\nminimax formulation.[[INT-POS,RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [SMY], [GEN]] Since most theory around divergence minimization is based\non the unmodified loss function for generator G, the experiments carried out in\nthe submission might yield somewhat surprising results compared the theory.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nIf I may summarize the key takeaways from Sections 5.4 and 6, they are:\n- GAN training remains difficult and good results are not guaranteed (2nd bullet\n  point)[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MIN]];\n- Gradient penalties work in all settings, but why is not completely clear;[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- NS-GANs + GPs seems to be best sample-generating combination, and faster than\n  WGAN-GP[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]].\n- Some of the used metrics can detect mode collapse.[[MET-NEU], [NULL], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe submission's (counter-)claims are served by example (cf. Figure 2, or Figure\n3 description, last sentence), and mostly relate to statements made in the WGAN\npaper (Arjovsky et al., 2017).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nAs a purely empirical study, it poses more new and open questions on GAN\noptimization than it is able to answer; providing theoretical answers is\ndeferred to future studies.[[MET-POS,FWK-NEU], [EMP-POS], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] This is not necessarily a bad thing, since the\nextensive experiments (both \"toy\" and \"real\") are well-designed, convincing and\ncomprehensible[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [DIS], [GEN]]. Novel combinations of GAN formulations (non-saturating with\ngradient penalties) are evaluated to disentangle the effects of formulation\nchanges.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nOverall, this work is providing useful experimental insights, clearly motivating\nfurther study.\n"[[OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
