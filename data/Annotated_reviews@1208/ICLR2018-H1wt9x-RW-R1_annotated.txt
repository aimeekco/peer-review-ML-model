"This is a well written paper on a compelling topic: how to train \"an automated teacher\" to use intuitive strategies  that would also apply to humans.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThe introduction is fairly strong, but this reviewer wishes that the authors would have come up with an intuitive example that illustrates why the strategy \"1) train S on random exs; 2) train T to pick exs for S\" makes sense.[[INT-POS,PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Such an example would dramatically improve the paper's readability.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [SUG], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper appears to be original, and the related work section is quite extensive.[[RWK-NEG], [NOV-POS], [FBK], [GEN]]\n\nA second significant improvement would be to add an in-depth  running example in section 3, so that the authors could illustrate why the BR strategy makes sense (Algorithm 2).[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEG], [QSN], [GEN]]"
