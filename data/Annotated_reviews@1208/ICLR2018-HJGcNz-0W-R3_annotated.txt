"This paper introduces a convolutional autoencoder for irregular graphs, specifically surfaces in the form of discrete meshes in 3D.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The underlying technique that is used to operate on the irregular graph is spectral decomposition, which enables convolutions in the spectral domain.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe spectral convolution methods have been applied to mesh data structures for about 5 years now, as stated in the paper as well [Bruna et al. 2013], [Defferrard et al. 2016], [Bronstein et al. 2017], [Li et al. 2017] ...[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The paper states that it builds upon the formulation in [Defferrard et al. 2016] as explained in section 3.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nGiven the facts above, I am having a hard time to understand the novelty of this paper?[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [QSN,CRT], [MAJ]] Is it the \"Mesh Upsampling\" operation defined at the end of page 4?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] If that is the case, it is not demonstrated in the paper that it actually works.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The main reason is that the original face mesh graph that goes into the convolution/downsampling\n operations is topologically preserved through the upconvolutions.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This means that the upsampling operation is not really upsampling a \"true\" graph/mesh.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The topology is already known, the upsampling just predicts a function on this topology.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n The choice of the face domain is also suspicious, since all faces are topologically the same graph (even though there are geometric variations).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Convolutions/downsampling-convolutions/upsampling that are demonstrated in the paper basically boil down to function prediction on the same exact global graph.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Face topologies are so regular that they can even be represented with a height map like geometry encoding in the image plane (See [1'] below).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\n To demonstrate the \"mesh/graph generation\" capability truly, the authors need to experiment on novel topology generation.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] As is, the paper does not bear enough novelty on top of [Defferrard et al. 2016], or is not demonstrating it even if there exists any.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n[1'] Z.
