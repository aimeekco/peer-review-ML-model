"This paper investigates a new approach to prevent a given classifier from adversarial examples. [[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]The most important contribution is that the proposed algorithm can be applied post-hoc to already trained networks.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Hence, the proposed algorithm (Stochastic Activation Pruning) can be combined with algorithms which prevent from adversarial examples during the training.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe proposed algorithm is clearly described.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However there are issues in the presentation.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nIn section 2-3, the problem setting is not suitably introduced.[[RWK-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]]\nIn particular one sentence that can be misleading:\n\u201cGiven a classifier, one common way to generate an adversarial example is to perturb the input in direction of the gradient\u2026\u201d\nYou should explain that given a classifier with stochastic output, the optimal way to generate an adversarial example is to perturb the input proportionally to the gradient. [[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [IMP-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]The practical way in which the adversarial examples are generated is not known to the player.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]] An adversary could choose any policy.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SUG], [GEN]] The only thing the player knows is the best adversarial policy.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [SUG], [GEN]]\n\nIn section 4, I do not understand why the adversary uses only the sign and not also the value of the estimated gradient.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Does it come from a high variance?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] If it is the case, you should explain that the optimal policy of the adversary is approximated by \u201cfast gradient sign method\u201d. [[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [SMY,CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn comparison to dropout algorithm, SAP shows improvements of accuracy against adversarial examples.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] SAP does not perform as well as adversarial training, but SAP could be used with a trained network.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS,CRT], [GEN]] \n\nOverall, this paper presents a practical method to prevent a classifier from adversarial examples, which can be applied in addition to adversarial training.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,OAL-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The presentation could be improved.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]"\n
