"The work is motivated by a real challenge of neuroimaging analysis: how to increase the amount of data to support the learning of brain decoding.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe contribution seems to mix two objectives: on one hand to prove that it is possible to do data augmentation for fMRI brain decoding, on the other hand to design (or better to extend) a new model (to be more precise two models).[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nConcerning the first objective the empirical results do not provide meaningful support that the generative model is really effective.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The improvement is really tiny and a statistical test (not included in the analysis) probably wouldn't pass a significant threshold.[[RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  This analysis is missing a straw man.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] It is not clear whether the difference in the evaluation measures is related to the greater number of examples or by the specific generative model.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nConcerning the contribution of the model, one novelty is the conditional formulation of the discriminator.[[OAL-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The design of the empirical evaluation doesn't address the analysis of the impact of this new formulation.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It is not clear whether the supposed improvement is related to the conditional formulation.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \nFigure 3 and Figure 5 illustrate the brain maps generated for Collection 1952 with ICW-GAN and for collection 503 with ACD-GAN.[[TNF-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] It is not clear how the authors operated the choices of these figures.[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] From the perspective of neuroscience a reader,  would expect to look at the brain maps for the same collection with different methods.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The pairwise brain maps would support the interpretation of the generated data.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] It is worthwhile to remember that the location of brain activations is crucial to detect whether the brain decoding (classification) relies on artifacts or confounds.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nMinor comments\n- typos: \"a first application or this\" => \"a first application of this\" (p.2)\n- \"qualitative quality\" (p.2)"[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]
