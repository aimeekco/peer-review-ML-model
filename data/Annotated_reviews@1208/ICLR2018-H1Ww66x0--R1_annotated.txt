"CONTRIBUTION\nThe main contribution of the paper is not clearly stated.[[PDI-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  To the reviewer, It seems \u201clife-long learning\u201d is the same as \u201conline learning\u201d.[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  However, the whole paper does not define what \u201clife-long learning\u201d is.[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nThe limited budget scheme is well established in the literature.[[CNT], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] \n1.

(7).[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Furthermore, the equation in algorithm 2 is not well formatted.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n1. The mapping function $phi$ appears in Eq. (1) without definition.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n2. The last equation in pp. 3 defines the decision function f by an inner product.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] In the equation, the notation x_t and i_t is not clearly defined.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  More seriously, a comma is missed in the definition of the inner product.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n3. Some equations are labeled but never referenced, e.g., Eq. (4).[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n4. The physical meaning of Eq.(7) is unclear.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  However, this equation is the key proposal of the paper. [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  For example, what is the output of the Eq. (7)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  What is the main objective of Eq. (7)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]   Moreover, what support vectors should be removed by optimizing Eq. (7)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]   One main issue is that the notation $phi$ is not clearly defined.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]    The computation of f-y_r\\phi(s_r) makes it hard to understand.[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]   Especially,  the dimension of $phi$ in Eq.(7) is unknown.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  \n\nABOUT EXPERIMENTS\n1.\tIt is unclear how to tune the hyperparameters.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n2.\tIn Table 1, the results only report the standard deviation of AUC.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  No standard deviations of nSV and Time are reported.\n"[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]
