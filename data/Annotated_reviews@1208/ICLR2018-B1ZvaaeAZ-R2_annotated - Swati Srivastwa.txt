"This is a well-written paper with good comparisons to a number of earlier approaches.[[RWK-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It focuses on an approach to get similar accuracy at lower precision, in addition to cutting down the compute costs.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Results with 2-bit activations and 4-bit weights seem to match baseline accuracy across the models listed in the paper.[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nOriginality\nThis seems to be first paper that consistently matches baseline results below int-8 accuracy, and shows a promising future direction.[[RES-POS,FWK-POS,OAL-POS], [NOV-POS,IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSignificance\nGoing down to below 8-bits and potentially all the way down to binary (1-bit weights and activations) is a promising direction for future hardware design.[[RES-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It has the potential to give good results at lower compute and more significantly in providing a lower power option, which is the biggest constraint for higher compute today.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nPros:\n- Positive results with low precision (4-bit, 2-bit and even 1-bit)[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- Moving the state of the art in low precision forward[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- Strong potential impact, especially on constrained power environments (but not limited to them)[[RWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- Uses same hyperparameters as original training, making the process of using this much simpler.[[EXP-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons/Questions\n- They mention not quantizing the first and last layer of every network.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] How much does that impact the overall compute?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n- Is there a certain width where 1-bit activation and weights would match the accuracy of the baseline model? [[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]This could be interesting for low power case, even if the \"effective compute\" is larger than the baseline.\n"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
