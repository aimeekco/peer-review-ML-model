"The paper proposes a piecewise linear activation function that is build on ELU.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In general it was an OK paper and there are many to be improved.\n\n+ Novelty seems minor.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In my sense, the authors do not provide any evidence theoretically or analysis on why the shifted version of ELU (which does not pass the origin) is more favorable.[[EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The idea proposed in the paper is just a stack of \"better\" experiments.[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Why the ultimate shape, irrelevant of their initialization (relu, lrelu, etc.) results in the same shape?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nSection 2 seems to provide a breakdown of how they formulate the piecewise linear function, which the difference from Alostinelli et al. 2014 is not clearly stated.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] In  section 3, the shifted version, \\delta, is abruptly proposed only based on \"results presented in 4.1\" could improve learning.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] This is not a professional ML paper looks like.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n+ Experiment not strong to support the idea.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Experiments are only conducted in CIFAR100.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This is obviously not enough.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] In Table 4 I see SvELU is better for LeNet and ShELU is better for Clevert-11 network, which form (Sh or Sv) do you use as final candidate? (via the title name, sh wins).[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] And the performance seems to be trivial among each other (ELU, 44.96, shelu 44.77), the current SOTAs for cifar100 could reach below 30%.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nAlso, the paper needs to be re-organized in a better way (eg., state clearly the difference from previous methods, how to formulate the story, etc.) For now, I don't think it is ready to ICLR.
