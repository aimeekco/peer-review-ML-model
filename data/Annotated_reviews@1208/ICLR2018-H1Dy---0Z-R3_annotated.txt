"This paper proposes a distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning at scale, specifically, focusing on adding parallelization in actor algorithm in Prioritized Experience Replay framework.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It has a very nice introduction and literature review of Prioritized experience replay[[INT-POS,RWK-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] and also suggested to parallelize the actor algorithm by simply adding more actors to execute in parallel, so that the experience replay can obtain more data for the learner to sample and learn.[[MET-POS,DAT-NEU], [EMP-POS], [SMY], [GEN]] Not surprisingly, as this framework is able to learn from way more data (e.g. in Atari), it outperforms the baselines, and Figure 4 clearly shows the more actors we have the better performance we will have. [[RWK-POS,DAT-NEU,MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [GEN]]\n\nWhile the strength of this paper is clearly the good writing as well as rigorous experimentation,[[EXP-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] the main concern I have with this paper is novelty.[[MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] It is in my opinion a somewhat trivial extension of the previous work of Prioritized experience replay in literature; hence the challenge of the work is not quite clear.[[MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]] Hence, I feel adding some practical learnings of setting up such infrastructure might add more flavor to this paper, for example.
