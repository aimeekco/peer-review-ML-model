"The paper \u2018Deep learning for Physical Process: incorporating prior physical knowledge\u2019 proposes\nto question the use of data-intensive strategies such as deep learning in solving physical \ninverse problems that are traditionally solved through assimilation strategies.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They notably show\nhow physical priors on a given phenomenon can be incorporated in the learning process and propose \nan application on the problem of estimating sea surface temperature directly from a given \ncollection of satellite images.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nAll in all the paper is very clear and interesting.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The results obtained on the considered problem[[PDI-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nare clearly of great interest, especially when compared to state-of-the-art assimilation strategies\nsuch as the one of B\u00e9r\u00e9ziat.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] While the learning architecture is not original in itself, it is \nshown that a proper physical regularization greatly improves the performance.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [SMY], [GEN]] For these reasons I \nbelieve the paper has sufficient merits to be published at ICLR. [[OAL-POS], [APR-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]That being said, I believe that \nsome discussions could strengthen the paper:\n - Most classical variational assimilation schemes are stochastic in nature, notably by incorporating\nuncertainties in the observation or physical evolution models.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [SUG], [MAJ]] It is still unclear how those uncertainties \ncan be integrated in the model[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]];\n - Assimilation methods are usually independent of the type of data at hand.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [DIS], [GEN]] It is not clear how the model\nlearnt on one particular type of data transpose to other data sequences. [[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]Notably, the question of transfer\nand generalization is of high relevance here.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] Does the learnt model performs well on other dataset (for instance,\nacquired on a different region or at a distant time). [[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]I believe this type of issue has to be examinated \nfor this type of approach to be widely use in inverse physical problems.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] \n"
