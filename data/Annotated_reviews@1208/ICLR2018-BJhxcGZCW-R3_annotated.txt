"In the medical context, this paper describes the classic problem of \"knowledge base completion\" from structured data only (no text).[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The authors argue for the advantages of a generative VAE approach (but without being convincing).[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  They do not cite the extensive literature on KB completion.[[BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  They present experimental results on their own data set, evaluating only against simpler baselines of their own VAE approach, not the pre-existing KB methods.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe authors seem unaware of a large literature on \"knowledge base completion.\"  E.g. [Bordes, Weston, Collobert, Bengio, AAAI, 2011],  [Socher et al 2013 NIPS], [Wang, Wang, Guo 2015 IJCAI], [Gardner, Mitchell 2015 EMNLP], [Lin, Liu, Sun, Liu, Zhu AAAI 2015], [Neelakantan, Roth, McCallum 2015],[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] \n\nThe paper claims that operating on pre-structured data only (without using text) is an advantage.[[PDI-NEG], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  I don't find the argument convincing.[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  There are many methods that can operate on pre-structured data only, but also have the ability to incorporate text data when available, e.g. \"universal schema\" [Riedel et al, 2014].[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper claims that \"discriminative approaches\" need to iterate over all possible entity pairs to make predictions. [[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In their generative approach they say they find outputs by \"nearest neighbor search.\"[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  But the same efficient search is possible in many of the classic \"discriminatively-trained\" KB completion models also.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nIt is admirable that the authors use an interesting (and to my knowledge novel) data set.[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  But the method should also be evaluated on multiple now-standard data sets, such as FB15K-237 or NELL-995.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  The method is evaluated only against their own VAE-based alternatives. [[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]] It should be evaluated against multiple other standard KB completion methods from the literature, such as Jason Weston's Trans-E, Richard Socher's Tensor Neural Nets, and Neelakantan's RNNs.\n"[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
