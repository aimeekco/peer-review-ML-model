"The paper presents a method for hierarchical object embedding by Gaussian densities for lexical entailment tasks.Each word is represented  by a diagonal Gaussian and the KL divergence is used as a directional distance measure.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] if D(f||g) < gamma then the concept represented by f entails the concept represented by g.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe main technical difference of the present work compared from the  main prior work (Vendrov, 2015) is that in addition to mean vector representation they use here also a variance component.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] The main modeling challenge here to to define a  good directional measure that can be suitable for lexical entailment.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] in Vendrov work they defined a partial ordering.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Here,  the KL is not symmetric but its directional aspect is not significant.[[MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nFor example if we set all the variances to be a unit matrix than the KL is collapsed to be a simple symmetrical Euclidean distance.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] We can also see from Table 1 that if we replace KL by its symmetrical variant we get similar results.[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Hence, I was not convinced that the propose KL+Gaussian modeling is suitable for directional relations.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe paper also presents several methods for negative samplings and according to table 4 there is a lot of performance variability based on the method that is used for selecting negative sampling.[[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] I find this component of the proposed algorithm  very heuristic.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nTo summarize, I don't think there is enough interesting novelty in this paper.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] If the focus of the  paper is on  obtaining good entailment results, maybe an NLP conference can be a more suitable venue.\n"[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]
