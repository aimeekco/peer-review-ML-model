"The authors present a method to enable robust generation of adversarial visual\ninputs for image classification.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThey develop on the theme that 'real-world' transformations typically provide a\ncountermeasure against adversarial attacks in the visual domain, to show that\ncontextualising the adversarial exemplar generation by those very\ntransformations can still enable effective adversarial example generation.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThey adapt an existing method for deriving adversarial examples to act under a\nprojection space (effectively a latent-variable model) which is defined through\na transformations distribution.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThey demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in the 2D and 3D\n(simulated and real) domains.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is clear to follow and the objective employed appears to be sound.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I\nlike the idea of using 3D generation, and particularly, 3D printing, as a means\nof generating adversarial examples -- there is definite novelty in that\nparticular exploration for adversarial examples.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nI did however have some concerns:\n\n1. What precisely is the distribution of transformations used for each[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n   experiment?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is it a PCFG?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Are the different components quantised such that\n   they are discrete rvs, or are there still continuous rvs? (For example, is\n   lighting discretised to particular locations or taken to be (say) a 3D\n   Gaussian?)[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] And on a related note, how were the number of sampled[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n   transformations chosen?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n   Knowing the distribution (and the extent of it's support) can help situate\n   the effectiveness of the number of samples taken to derive the adversarial\n   input.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n2. While choosing the distance metric in transformed space, LAB is used, but\n   for the experimental results, l_2 is measured in RGB space -- showing the\n   RGB distance is perhaps not all that useful given it's not actually being\n   used in the objective.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I would perhaps suggest showing LAB, maybe in\n   addition to RGB if required.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n3. Quantitative analysis: I would suggest reporting confidence intervals;\n   perhaps just the 1st standard deviation over the accuracies for the true and\n   'adversarial' labels -- the min and max don't help too much in understanding\[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]n   what effect the monte-carlo approximation of the objective has on things.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n   Moreover, the min and max are only reported for the 2D and rendered 3D\n   experiments -- it's missing for the 3D printing experiment.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\n4. Experiment power: While the experimental setup seems well thought out and\n   structured, the sample size (i.e, the number of entities considered) seems a\n   bit too small to draw any real conclusions from.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] There are 5 exemplar\n   objects for the 3D rendering experiment and only 2 for the 3D printing one.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n   While I understand that 3D printing is perhaps not all that scalable to be\n   able to rattle off many models, the 3D rendering experiment surely can be\n   extended to include more models?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MAJ]] Were the turtle and baseball models chosen\n   randomly, or chosen for some particular reason?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Similar questions for the 5\n   models in the 3D rendering experiment.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n5. 3D printing experiment transformations: While the 2D and 3D rendering\n   experiments explicitly state that the sampled transformations were random,\n   the 3D printing one says \"over a variety of viewpoints\".[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Were these\n   viewpoints chosen randomly?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nMost of these concerns are potentially quirks in the exposition rather than any\nissues with the experiments conducted themselves.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] For now, I think the\nsubmission is good for a weak accept [[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]\u2013- if the authors address my concerns, and/or\ncorrect my potential misunderstanding of the issues, I'd be happy to upgrade my\nreview to an accept."[[EXT-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MIN]]
