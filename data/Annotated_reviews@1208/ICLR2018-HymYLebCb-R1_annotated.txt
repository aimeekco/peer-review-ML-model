"The paper proposes to use 2-d image representation techniques as a means of learning representations of graphs via their adjacency matrices.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The adjacency matrix (or a subgraph of it) is first re-ordered to produce some canonical ordering which can then be fed into an image representation method.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  This can then be fed into a classifier.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThis is a little too unprincipled for my taste.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In particular the paper uses a Caffe reference model on top of the adjacency matrix, rather than learning a method specifically for graphs.[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Perhaps this is due to a lack of available graph training data, but it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nMaybe I missed or overlooked some detail, but I didn't spot exactly what the classification task was.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I think the goal is to identify which of the graphs a subgraph belongs to?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] I'm not sure how relevant this graph classification task is.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\nThe method does prove that the Caffe reference model maintains some information that can be used for classification, but this doesn't really suggest a generalizable method that we could confidently use for a variety of tasks.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It's surprising that it works at all, but ultimately doesn't reveal a big scientific finding that could be re-used."[[MET-NEG,FWK-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
