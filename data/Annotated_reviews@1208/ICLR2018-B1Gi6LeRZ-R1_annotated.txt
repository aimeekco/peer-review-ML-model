"Overall: Authors defined a new learning task that requires a DNN to predict mixing ratio between sounds from two different classes.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Previous approaches to training data mixing are (1) from random classes, or (2) from the same class.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The presented approach mixes sounds from specific pairs of classes to increase discriminative power of the final learned network.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Results look like significant improvements over standard learning setups.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nDetailed Evaluation: The approach presented is simple, clearly presented, and looks effective on benchmarks.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] In terms of originality, it is different from warping training example for the same task and it is a good extension of previously suggested example mixing procedures with a targeted benefit for improved discriminative power.[[RWK-POS,OAL-POS], [NOV-POS,CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The authors have also provided extensive analysis from the point of views (1) network architecture, (2) mixing method, (3) number of labels / classes in mix, (4) mixing layers -- really well done due-diligence across different model and task parameters.[[MET-POS,ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nMinor Asks:\n(1) Clarification on how the error rates are defined.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Especially since the standard learning task could be 0-1 loss and this new BC learning task could be based on distribution divergence (if we're not using argmax as class label).[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n(2) #class_pairs targets as analysis - The number of epochs needed is naturally going to be higher since the BC-DNN has to train to predict mixing ratios between pairs of classes.[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Since pairs of classes could be huge if the total number of classes is large, it'll be nice to see how this scales.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] I.e. are we talking about a space of 10 total classes or 10000 total classes?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] How does num required epochs get impacted as we increase this class space?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n(3) Clarify how G_1/20 and G_2/20 is important / derived - I assume it's unit conversion from decibels.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n(4) Please explain why it is important to use the smoothed average of 10 softmax predictions in evaluation...[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] what happens if you just randomly pick one of the 10 crops for prediction?"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
