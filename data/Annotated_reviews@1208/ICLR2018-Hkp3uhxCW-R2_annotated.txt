"This paper proposes an interesting variational posterior approximation for the weights of an RNN.[[INT-NEU,MET-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The paper also proposes a scheme for assessing the uncertainty of the predictions of an RNN.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\npros:\n--I liked the posterior sharpening idea.[[MET-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It was well motivated from a computational cost perspective hence the use of a hierarchical prior.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n--I liked the uncertainty analysis.[[ANA-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] There are many works on Bayesian neural networks but they never present an analysis of the uncertainty introduced in the weights.[[EXT-NEG], [CNT], [CNT], [CNT]] These works can benefit from the uncertainty analysis scheme introduced in this paper.[[ANA-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n--The experiments were well carried through.[[EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\ncons:\n--Change the title! the title is too vague. [[ABS-NEG], [APR-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\"Bayesian recurrent neural networks\" already exist and is rather vague for what is being described in this paper.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]\n--There were a lot of unanswered questions:\n (1) how does sharpening lead to lower variance?[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,QSN], [MIN]] This was a claim in the paper and there was no theoretical justification or an empirical comparison of the gradient variance in the experiment section[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n(2) how is the level of uncertainty related to performance?[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] It would have been insightful to see effect of \\sigma_0 on the performance rather than report the best result. [[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n(3) what was the actual computational cost for the BBB RNN and the baselines?[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY,QSN], [GEN]]\n--There were very minor typos and some unclear connotations. [[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]For example there is no such thing as a \"variational Bayes model\".[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nI am willing to adjust my rating when the questions and remarks above get addressed."[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]
