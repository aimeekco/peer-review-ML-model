"The proposed approach, GTI, has many free parameters: number of layers L, number of communities in each layer, number of non-overlapping subgraphs M, number of nodes in each subgraph k, etc.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MIN]]  No analysis is reported on how these affect the performance of GTI.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nGTI uses the Louvain hierarchical community detection method to identify the hierarchy in the graph and METIS to partition the communities.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MIN]]  How important are these two methods to the success of GTI?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nWhy is it reasonable to restore a k-by-k adjacency matrix from the standard uniform distribution (as stated in Section 2.1)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nWhy is the stride for the convolutional/deconvoluational layers set to 2 (as stated in Section 2.1)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nEquation 1 has a symbol E in it.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  E is defined (in Section 2.2) to be \"all the inter-subgraph (community) edges identified by the Louvain method for each hierarchy.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\"  However, E can be intra-community because communities are partitioned by METIS.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  More discussion is needed about the role of edges in E.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nEquation 3 sparsifies (i.e. prunes the edges) of a graph -- namely $re_{G}$.[[TNF-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  However, it is not clear how one selects a $re^{i}{G}$ from among the various i values.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  The symbol i is an index into $CV_{i}$, the cut-value of the i-th largest unique weight-value.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nWas the edge-importance reported in Section 2.3 checked against various measures of edge importance such as edge betweenness?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nTable 1 needs more discussion in terms of retained edge percentage for ordered stages.[[TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]  Should one expect a certain trend in these sequences?[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nAlmost all of the experiments are qualitative and can be easily made quantitive by comparing PageRank or degree of nodes.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThe discussion on graph sampling does not include how much of the graph was sampled.[[TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]]  Thus, the comparisons in Tables 2 and 3 are not fair.\n\nThe most realistic graph generator is the BTER model.  See http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/bter_supplement/ and http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/feastpack/doc_bter_match.html.\n\nA minor point: The acronym GTI is never defined."[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
