"The paper presents a multi-task architecture that can perform multiple tasks across multiple different domains.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors design an architecture that works on image captioning, image classification, machine translation and parsing.\[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]n\nThe proposed model can maintain performance of single-task models and in some cases show slight improvements.[[RES-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] This is the main take-away from this paper.[[OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThere is a factually incorrect statement - depthwise separable convolutions were not introduced in Chollet 2016.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Section 2 of the same paper also notes it (depthwise convolutions can be traced back to at least 2012)."[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
