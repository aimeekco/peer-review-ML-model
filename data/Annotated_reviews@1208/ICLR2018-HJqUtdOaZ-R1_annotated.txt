"The paper presents a method for feature projection which uses a two level neural network like structure to generate new features from the input features.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The weights of the NN like structure are optimised using a genetic search algorithm which optimises the cross-validation error of a nearest neighbor classifier.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The method is tested on four simple UCI datasets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] There is nothing interesting or novel about the paper.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It is not clear whether the GA optimisation takes place on the level of cross validation error estimation or within an internal validation set as it should have been the case.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The very high accuracies reported seem to hint the latter, which is a serious methodological error.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The poor language and presentation does not help in clearing that, as it does not help in general.
