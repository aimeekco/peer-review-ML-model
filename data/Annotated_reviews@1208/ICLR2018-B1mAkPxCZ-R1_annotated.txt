"This paper proposes a feature augmentation method for one-shot learning.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The proposed approach is very interesting.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, the method needs to be further clarified and the experiments need to be improved.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\nDetails:\n1. The citation format used in the paper is not appropriate, which makes the paper, especially the related work section, very inconvenient to read.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n2. The approach:\n(1) Based on the discussion in the related work section and the approach section, it seems the proposed approach proposes to augment each instance in the visual feature space by adding more features, as shown by [x_i; x_i^A] in 2.3.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  However, under one-shot learning, won\u2019t this  make each class still have only one instance for training?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\n(2) Moreover, the augmenting features x_i^A (regardless A=F, G, or H), are in the same space as the original features x_i. Hence x_i^A is rather an augmenting instance than additional features. What makes feature augmentation better than instance augmentation?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  \n\n(3) It is not clear how will the vocabulary-information be exploited?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  In particular, how to ensure the semantic space u to be same as the vocabulary semantic space?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  How to generate the neighborhood in Neigh(\\hat{u}_i) on page 5?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  \n\n3.  In the experiments: \n(1) The authors didn\u2019t compare the proposed method with existing state-of-the-art one-shot learning approaches, which makes the results not very convincing.[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n\n(2) The results are reported for different numbers of augmented instances.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Clarification is needed. \n"[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
