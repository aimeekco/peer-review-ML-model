"This paper studies a new architecture DualAC.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The author give strong and convincing justifications based on the Lagrangian dual of the Bellman equation (although not new, introducing this as the justification for the architecture design is plausible).[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [SMY], [MAJ]]\n\nThere are several drawbacks of the current format of the paper:\n1. The algorithm is vague.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Alg 1 line 5: 'closed form': there is no closed form in Eq(14).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It is just an MC approximation.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nline 6: Decay O(1/t^\\beta). This is indeed vague albeit easy to understand.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The algorithm requires that every step is crystal clear.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n2. Also, there are several format error which may be due to compiling, e.g., line 2 of Abstract,'Dual-AC ' (an extra space).[[ABS-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] There are many format errors like this throughout the paper.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The author is suggested to do a careful format check.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n3. The author is suggested to explain more about the necessity of introducing path regularization and SDA. The current justification is reasonable but too brief.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n4. The experimental part is ok to me, but not very impressive.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall, this seems to be a nice paper to me.[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]"
