"The authors proposed a generative model of random walks on graphs.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Using GAN, the architecture allows for model-agnostic learning, controllable fitting, ensemble graph generation.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It also produces meaningful node embeddings with semi-interpretable latent spaces.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The overall framework could be relevant to multiple areas in graph analytics, including graph comparison, graph sampling, graph embedding and relational feature selection.[[MET-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The draft is well written with convincing experiments.[[EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I support the acceptances of this paper.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nI do have a few questions that might help further improve the draft.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] More baseline besides DC-SBM could better illustrate the power of GAN in learning longer random walk trajectories.[[RWK-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] DC-SBM, while a generative model, inherently can only capture first order random walks with target degree biases, and generally over-fits into degree sequences.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Are there existing generative models based on walk paths?[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThe choice of early stopping is a very interesting problem especially for the EO-creitenrion.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] In Fig3 (b), it seems assortativity is over-fitted beyond 40k iterations.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It might be helpful to discuss more about the over-fitting of different graph properties.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nThe node classification experiment could use a bit more refinement.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] The curves in Fig. 5(a) are not well explained.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] What is the \"combined\"?[[TNF-NEU], [CNT], [QSN], [MIN]] The claim of competitive performance needs better justification according to the presentation of the F1 scores.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThe Latent variable interpolation experiment could also use more explanations.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] How is the 2d subspace chosen?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] What is the intuition behind the random walks and graphs of Fig 6?[[EXP-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  Can you provide visualizations of the communities of the interpolated graphs in Fig 7?
