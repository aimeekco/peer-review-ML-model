"This paper presents an alternative approach to constructing variational lower bounds on data log likelihood in deep, directed generative models with latent variables.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Specifically, the authors propose using approximate posteriors shared across groups of examples, rather than posteriors which treat examples independently.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The group-wise posteriors allow amortization of the information cost KL(group posterior || prior) across all examples in the group, which the authors liken to the \"KL annealing\" tricks that are sometimes used to avoid posterior collapse when training models with strong decoders p(x|z) using current techniques for approximate variational inference in deep nets.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe presentation of the core idea is solid,[[PDI-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] though it did take two read-throughs before the equations really clicked for me.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] I think the paper could be improved by spending more time on a detailed description of the model for the Omniglot experiments (as illustrated in Figure 3). E.g., explicitly describing how group-wise and per-example posteriors are composed in this model, using Equations and pseudo-code for the main training loop, would have saved me some time.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] For readers less familiar with amortized variational inference in deep nets, the benefit would be larger.[[MET-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nI appreciate that the authors developed extensions of the core method to more complex group structures,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] though I didn't find the related experiments particularly convincing.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nOverall, I like this paper and think the underlying group-wise posterior construction trick is worth exploring further.[[FWK-POS,OAL-NEU], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Of course, the elephant in the room is how to determine the groups across which the posteriors can be shared and their information costs amortized."[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]
