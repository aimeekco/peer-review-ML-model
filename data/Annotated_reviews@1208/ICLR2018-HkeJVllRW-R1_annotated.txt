"\n\nThis paper presented interesting ideas to reduce the redundancy in convolution kernels.[[INT-POS,PDI-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] They are very close to existing algorithms[[RWK-POS], [null], [APC], [GEN]].\n\n(1)\tThe SW-SC kernel (Figure 2 (a)) is an extension of the existing shaped kernel (Figure 1 (c)).[[RWK-NEU,TNF-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n(2)\tThe CW-SC kernel (Figure 2 (c)) is very similar to interleaved group convolutions.[[RWK-NEU,TNF-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The CW-SC kernel can be regarded as a redundant version of interleaved group convolutions [1].[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nI would like to see more discussions on the relation to these methods and more strong arguments for convincing reviewers to accept this paper.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [REC-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,FBK], [MAJ]] \n\n[1] Interleaved Group Convolutions.
