"The paper proposes to improve the kernel approximation of random features by using quadratures, in particular, stochastic spherical-radial rules. [[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The quadrature rules have smaller variance given the same number of random features, and experiments show its reconstruction error and classification accuracies are better than existing algorithms.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nIt is an interesting paper, but it seems the authors are not aware of some existing works [1, 2] on quadrature for random features.[[RWK-NEG], [NULL], [CRT], [MAJ]] Given these previous works, the contribution and novelty of the paper is limited.[[MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\n[1] Francis Bach.
