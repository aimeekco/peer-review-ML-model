"This paper proposes a hybrid Homomorphic encryption system that is well suited for privacy-sensitive data inference applications with the deep learning paradigm.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \nThe paper presents a well laid research methodology that shows a good decomposition of the problem at hand and the approach foreseen to solve it.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It is well reflected in the paper and most importantly the rationale for the implementation decisions taken is always clear.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe results obtained (as compared to FHEW) seem to indicate well thought off decisions taken to optimize the different gates' operations as clearly explained in the paper.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] For example, reducing bootstrapping operations by two-complementing both the plaintext and the ciphertext, whenever the number of 1s in the plain bit-string is greater than the number of 0s (3.4/Page 6).[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nResult interpretation is coherent with the approach and data used and shows a good understanding of the implications of the implementation  decisions made in the system and the data sets used.[[DAT-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nOverall, fine work, well organized, decomposed, and its rationale clearly explained.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The good results obtained support the design decisions made.[[RES-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]\nOur main concern is regarding thorough comparison to similar work and provision of comparative work assessment to support novelty claims.[[RWK-NEU], [NOV-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nNota: \n     - In Figure 4/Page 4: AND Table A(1)/B(0), shouldn't  A And B be 0?[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n     - Unlike Figure 3/Page 3, in Figure 2/page 2, shouldn't  operations' precedence prevail (No brackets), therefore 1+2*2=5?[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]"
