"The paper devises a sparse kernel for RNNs which is urgently needed because current GPU deep learning libraries (e.g., CuDNN) cannot exploit sparsity when it is presented and because a number of works have proposed to sparsify/prune RNNs so as to be able to run on devices with limited compute power (e.g., smartphones).[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU,EXT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Unfortunately, due to the low-level and GPU specific nature of the work, I would think that this work will be better critiqued in a more GPU-centric conference.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG], [DIS], [GEN]] Another concern is that while experiments are provided to demonstrate the speedups achieved by exploiting sparsity, these are not contrasted by presenting the loss in accuracy caused by introducing sparsity (in the main portion of the paper).[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It may be the case by reducing density to 1% we can speedup by N fold but this observation may not have any value if the accuracy becomes  abysmal.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nPros:\n- Addresses an urgent and timely issue of devising sparse kernels for RNNs on GPUs[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- Experiments show that the kernel can effectively exploit sparsity while utilizing GPU resources well[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n- This work may be better reviewed at a more GPU-centric conference[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n- Experiments (in main paper) only show speedups and do not show loss of accuracy due to sparsity"[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]
