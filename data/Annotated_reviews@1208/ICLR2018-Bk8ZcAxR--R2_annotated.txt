"- This paper shows an equivalence between proto value functions and successor representations.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It then derives the idea of eigen options from the successor representation as a mechanism for option discovery.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper shows that even under a random policy, the eigen options can lead to purposeful options\n\n[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]- I think this is an important conceptual paper.[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] Automatic option discovery from raw sensors is perhaps one of the biggest open problems in RL research.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] This paper offers a new conceptual setup to look at the problem and consolidates different views (successor repr, proto values, eigen decomposition) in a principled manner.[[OAL-POS], [NOV-NEU], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\n- I would be keen to see eigen options being used inside of the agent.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Have authors performed any experiments ?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\n- How robust are the eigen options for the Atari experiments?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  Basically how hand picked were the options?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  \n\n- Is it possible to compute eigenoptions online??[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  This seems crucial for scaling up this approach"?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
