"The authors use deep learning to learn a surrogate model for the motion vector in the advection-diffusion equation that they use to forecast sea surface temperature.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In particular, they use a CNN encoder-decoder to learn a motion field, and a warping function from the last component to provide forecasting.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nI like the idea of using deep learning for physical equations.[[PDI-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] I would like to see a description of the algorithm with the pseudo-code in order to understand the flow of the method.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] I got confused at several points because it was not clear what was exactly being estimated with the CNN.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Having an algorithmic environment would make the description easier. [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]I know that authors are going to publish the code, but this is not enough at this point of the revision.[[MET-NEU], [REC-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] \n\nPhysical processes in Machine learning have been studied from the perspective of Gaussian processes. Just to mention a couple of references \u201cLinear latent force models using Gaussian processes\u201d and \"Numerical Gaussian Processes for Time-dependent and Non-linear Partial Differential Equations[[MET-NEU, RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\"\n\nIn Theorem 2, do you need to care about boundary conditions for your equation? [[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]I didn\u2019t see any mention to those in the definition for I(x,t). You only mention initial conditions.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] How do you estimate the diffusion parameter D?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Are you assuming isotropic diffusion? Is that realistic? [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]Can you provide more details about how you run the data assimilation model in the experiments? Did you use your own code?[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n"
