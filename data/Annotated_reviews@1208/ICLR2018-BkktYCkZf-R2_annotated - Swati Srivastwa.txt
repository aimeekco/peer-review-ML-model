"In this paper, the authors propose to have a different learning rate depending on the class of the examples when learning a neural network.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThis paper's contribution are quite moderate, as the proposed method seems to be a very natural extension but it is backed up by lots of numerical results. [[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\nHowever, it would have been interesting to show the evolution of the learning rates (for every class) along the epochs and to correlate this evolution with the classes ratio or their separability or to analyse more in depths the properties of the obtained networks.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [GEN]]\n\nIt is rather unclear why changing the learning rate affects the performance of the model and it is would have been interesting to discuss.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nMoreover, it would be interesting to show if this class-based learning rates changes the convergence of the model or if the early stopping occurs earlier etc...\n\n"[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
