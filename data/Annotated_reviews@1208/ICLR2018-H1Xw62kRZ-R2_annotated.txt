"The paper presents a reinforcement learning-based approach for program synthesis.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The proposed approach claims two advantages over a baseline maximum likelihood estimation-based approach.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  MLE-based methods penalize syntactically different but semantically equivalent programs.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  Further, typical program synthesis approaches don't explicitly learn to produce correct syntax.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The proposed approach uses a syntax-checker to limit the next-token distribution to syntactically-valid tokens.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe approach, and its constituent contributions, i.e. of using RL for program synthesis, and limiting to syntactically valid programs, are novel.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Although both the contributions are fairly obvious, there is of course merit in empirically validating these ideas.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe paper presents comparisons with baseline methods.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The improvements over the baseline methods is small but substantial, and enough experimental details are provided to reproduce the results.[[RWK-NEU,RES-POS], [CMP-NEU,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]   However, there is no comparison with other approaches in the literature.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] The authors claim to improve the state-of-the-art, but fail to mention and compare with the state-of-the-art, such as [1].[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I do find it hard to trust papers which do not compare with results from other papers.[[EXT-NEG], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nPros:\n1. Well-written paper, with clear contributions.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n2. Good empirical evaluation with ablations.[[EXP-POS,ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n1. No SOTA comparison.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n2. Only one task / No real-world task, such as Excel Flashfill.[[CNT], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n[1]: \"Neural Program Meta-Induction\", Jacob Devlin, Rudy Bunel, Rishabh Singh, Matthew Hausknecht, Pushmeet Kohli"[[BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]
