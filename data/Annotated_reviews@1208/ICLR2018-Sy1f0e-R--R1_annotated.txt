"In the paper, the authors discuss several GAN evaluation metrics.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nSpecifically, the authors pointed out some desirable properties that GANS evaluation metrics should satisfy.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\nFor those properties raised, the authors experimentally evaluated whether existing metrics satisfy those properties or not.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nSection 4 summarizes the results, which concluded that the Kernel MMD and 1-NN classifier in the feature space are so far recommended metrics to be used.[[RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nI think this paper tackles an interesting and important problem, what metrics are preferred for evaluating GANs.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nIn particular, the authors showed that Inception Score, which is one of the most popular metric, is actually not preferred for several reasons.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nThe result, comparing data distributions and the distribution of the generator would be the preferred choice (that can be attained by Kernel MMD and 1-NN classifier), seems to be reasonable.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nThis would not be a surprising result as the ultimate goal of GAN is mimicking the data distribution.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nHowever, the result is supported by exhaustive experiments making the result highly convincing.[[RES-POS,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall, I think this paper is worthy for acceptance as several GAN methods are proposed and good evaluation metrics are needed for further improvements of the research field.\n"[[MET-POS,FWK-NEU,OAL-POS], [SUB-NEU,IMP-NEU,REC-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
