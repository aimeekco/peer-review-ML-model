"This paper introduce a times-series prediction model that works in two phases.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] First learns a deterministic mapping from x to y.phases.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] And then train another net to predict future frames given the input and residual error from the first network.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] And does sampling for novel inputs by sampling the residual error collected from the training set. [[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nPros:\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nGood cover of relevant work in sec 3.[[CNT], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons\nThe paper emphasis on the fact the their modeling multi-modal time series distributions, which is almost the case for most of the video sequence data.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] But unfortunately doesn\u2019t show any results even qualitative like generated samples for other  work on next frame video prediction.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] The shown samples from model looks extremely, low quality and really hard to see the authors interpretations of it.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nThere are many baselines missing.[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  One simple one would be what if they only used the f and draw z samples for N(0,1)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]  VAE is very power latent variable model which also not being compared against.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  It is not clear what implantation of GAN they are using?.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MAJ]] Vanilla GAN is know to be hard to train and there has been many variants recently that overcome some of those difficulties and its mode collapse problem. \n"[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
