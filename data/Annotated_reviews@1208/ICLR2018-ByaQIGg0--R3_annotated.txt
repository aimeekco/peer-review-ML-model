"1. This is a good application paper, can be quite interesting in a workshop related to Deep Learning applications to physical sciences and engineering.[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]\n2. Lacks in sufficient machine learning related novelty required to be relevant in the main conference[[MET-NEU], [APR-NEU,NOV-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n3. Design, solving inverse problem using Deep Learning are not quite novel, see\nStoecklein et al. Deep Learning for Flow Sculpting: Insights into Efficient Learning using Scientific Simulation Data. Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 46368 (2017).[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG,BIB-NEU], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n4. However, this paper introduces two different types of networks for \"parametrization\" and \"physical behavior\" mapping, which is interesting, can be very useful as surrogate models for CFD simulations.[[MET-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n5. It will be interesting to see the impacts of physics based knowledge on choice of network architecture, hyper-parameters and other training considerations.[[EXP-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n6. Just claiming the generalization capability of deep networks is not enough, need to show how much the model can interpolate or extrapolate?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN,CRT], [MAJ]] what are the effects of regulariazations in this regard?
