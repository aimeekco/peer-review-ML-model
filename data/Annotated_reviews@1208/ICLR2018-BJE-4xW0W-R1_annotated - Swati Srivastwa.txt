"The paper describes a way of combining a causal graph describing the dependency structure of labels with two conditional GAN architectures (causalGAN and causalBEGAN) that generate  images conditioning on the binary labels.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Ideally, this type of approach should allow not only to generate images from an observational distribution of labels (e.g. P(Moustache=1)), but also from unseen interventional distributions (e.g. P(Male=0 | do(Moustache =1)).[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nMaybe I misunderstood something, but one big problem I have with the paper is that for a \u201ccausalGAN\u201d approach it doesn\u2019t seem to do much causality.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The (known) causal graph is only used to model the dependencies of the labels, which the authors call the \u201cCausal Controller\u201d.[[MET-NEG,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] On this graph, one can perform interventions and get a different distribution of labels from the original causal graph (e.g. a distribution of labels in which women have the same probability as men of having moustaches).[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Given the labels, the rest of the architecture are extensions of conditional GANs, a causalGAN with a Labeller and an Anti-Labeller (of which I\u2019m not completely sure I understand the necessity) and an extension of a BEGAN.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The results are not particularly impressive, but that is not an issue for me.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nMoreover sometimes the descriptions are a bit imprecise and unstructured.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, Theorem 1 is more like a list of desiderata and it already contains a forward reference to page 7.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The definition of intervention in the Background applies only to do-interventions (Pearl 2009) and not to general interventions (e.g. consider soft, uncertain or fat-hand interventions).[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nOverall, I think the paper proposes some interesting ideas,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but it doesn\u2019t explore them yet in detail.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]] I would be interested to know what happens if the causal graph is not known, and even worse cannot be completely identified from data (so there is an equivalence class of possible graphs), or potentially is influenced by latent factors.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Moreover, I would be very curious about ways to better integrate causality and generative models, that don\u2019t focus only on the label space.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\n\nMinor details:\nPersonally I\u2019m not a big fan of abusing colons (\u201c:\u201d) instead of points (\u201c.\u201d).[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] See for example the first paragraph of the Related Work.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nEDIT: I read the author's rebuttal, but it has not completely addressed my concerns, so my rating has not changed."[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
