"[Apologies for short review, I got called in late.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Marking my review as \"educated guess\" since i didn't have time for a detailed review][[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper proposes an algorithm to tune the momentum and learning rate for SGD.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] While the algorithm does not have a theory for general non-quadratic functions,[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] experimental validation is extensive, making it a worthy contribution in my opinion.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I have personally tried the algorithm when the paper came out and can vouch for the empirical results presented here."[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
