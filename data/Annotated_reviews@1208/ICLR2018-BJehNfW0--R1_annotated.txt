"The paper adds to the discussion on the question whether Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) learn the target distribution.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Recent theoretical analysis of GANs by Arora et al. show that of the discriminator capacity of is bounded, then there is a solution the closely meets the objective but the output distribution has a small support.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper attempts to estimate the size of the support for solutions produced by typical GANs experimentally.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The main idea used to estimate the support is the Birthday theorem that says that with probability at least 1/2, a uniform sample (with replacement) of size S from a set of  N elements will have a duplicate given S > \\sqrt{N}.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The suggested plan is to manually check for duplicates in a sample of size s and if duplicate exists, then estimate the size of the support to be s^2.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] One should note that the birthday theorem assumes uniform sampling. [[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] In the revised versions, it has been clarified that the tested distribution is not assumed to be uniform but the distribution has \"effectively\" small support size using an indistinguishability notion.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Given this method to estimate the size of the support, the paper also tries to study the behaviour of estimated support size with the discriminator capacity.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Arora et al. showed that the output support size has nearly linear dependence on the discriminator capacity.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experiments are conducted in this paper to study this behaviour by varying the discriminator capacity and then estimating the support size using the idea described above.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] A result similar to that of Arora et al. is also given for the special case of Encoder-Decoder GAN.[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nEvaluation: \nSignificance: The question whether GANs learn the target distribution is important and any  significant contribution to this discussion is of value.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nClarity: The paper is written well and the issues raised are well motivated and proper background is given.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-POS,IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nOriginality: The main idea of trying to estimate the size of the support using a few samples by using birthday theorem seems new.[[OAL-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nQuality: The main idea of this work is to give a estimation technique for the support size for the output distribution of GANs. \n"[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
