"I hate to say that the current version of this paper is not ready, as it is poorly written.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The authors present some observations of the weaknesses of the existing vector space models and list a 6-step approach for refining existing word vectors (GloVe in this work), and test the refined vectors on 80 TOEFL questions and 50 ESL questions.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] In addition to the incoherent presentation, the proposed method lacks proper justification.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] Given the small size of the datasets, it is also unclear how generalizable the approach is.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nPros:\n  1. Experimental study on retrofitting existing word vectors for ESL and TOEFL lexical similarity datasets[[DAT-NEU,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\u000b  1. The paper is poorly written and the proposed methods are not well justified.[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n  2. Results on tiny datasets\n"[[DAT-NEG,RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]
