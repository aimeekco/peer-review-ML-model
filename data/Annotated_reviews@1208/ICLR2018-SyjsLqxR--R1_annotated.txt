"Summary:\n\nThis paper empirically studies adversarial perturbations dx and what the effects are of adversarial training (AT) with respect to shared (dx fools for many x) and singular (only for a single x) perturbations.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experiments use a (previously published) iterative fast-gradient-sign-method and use a Resnet on CIFAR.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe authors conclude that in this experimental setting:\n- AT seems to defend models against shared dx's.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- This is visible on universal perturbations, which become less effective as more AT is applied.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- AT decreases the effectiveness of adversarial perturbations, e.g. AT decreases the number of adversarial perturbations that fool both an input x and x with e.g. a contrast change.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- Singular perturbations are easily detected by a detector model, as such perturbations don't change much when applying AT.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nPro:\n- Paper addresses an important problem: qualitative / quantitative understanding of the behavior of adversarial perturbations is still lacking.[[PDI-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]\n- The visualizations of universal perturbations as they change during AT are nice.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- The basic observation wrt the behavior of AT is clearly communicated.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCon:\n- The experiments performed are interesting directions, although unfocused and rather limited in scope.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] For instance, does the same phenomenon happen for different datasets?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Different models?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- What happens when we use adversarial attacks different from FGSM?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Do we get similar results?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n- The papers lacks a more in-depth theoretical analysis.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Is there a principled reason AT+FGSM defends against universal perturbations?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nOverall:\n- As is, it seems to me the paper lacks a significant central message (due to limited and unfocused experiments) or significant new theoretical insight into the effect of AT.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] A number of questions addressed are interesting starting points towards a deeper understanding of *how* the observations can be explained and more rigorous empirical investigations.\n\nDetailed:\n-\n"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
