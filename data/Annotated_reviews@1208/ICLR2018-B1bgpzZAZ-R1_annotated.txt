"This paper gives an elaboration on the Gated Attention Reader (GAR) adding gates based on answer elimination in multiple choice reading comprehension.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  I found the formal presentation of the model reasonably clear the the empirical evaluation reasonably compelling.[[EXP-POS], [PNF-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nIn my opinion the main weakness of the paper is the focus on the RACE dataset.[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  This dataset has not attracted much attention and most work in reading comprehension has now moved to the SQUAD dataset for which there is an active leader board.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  I realize that SQUAD is not explicitly multiple choice and that this is a challenge for an answer elimination architecture.[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]  However, it seems that answer elimination might be applied to each choice of the initial position of a possible answer span. [[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] In any case, competing with an active leader board would be much more compelling."[[RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]
