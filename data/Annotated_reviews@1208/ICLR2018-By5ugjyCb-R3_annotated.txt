"This paper presents a new idea to use PACT to quantize networks, and showed improved compression and comparable accuracy to the original network.[[INT-POS,PDI-POS], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The idea is interesting and novel that PACT has not been applied to compressing networks in the past.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The results from this paper is also promising that it showed convincing compression results.[[RES-POS,ANA-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nThe experiments in this paper is also solid and has done extensive experiments on state of the art datasets and networks.[[EXP-POS], [SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Results look promising too.[[RES-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall the paper is a descent one, but with limited novelty.[[OAL-POS], [NOV-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]] I am a weak reject"[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]
