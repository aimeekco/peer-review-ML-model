"The paper proposes a new method for detecting out of distribution samples.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The core idea is two fold: when passing a new image through the (already trained) classifier, first preprocess the image by adding a small perturbation to the image pushing it closer to the highest softmax output and second, add a temperature to the softmax.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Then, a simple decision is made based on the output of the softmax of the perturbed image - if it is able some threshold then the image is considered in-distribution otherwise out-distribution.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThis paper is well written, easy to understand and presents a simple and apparently effective method of detecting out of distribution samples.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The authors evaluate on cifar-10/100 and several out of distribution datasets and this method outperforms the baseline by significant margins.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They also examine the effects of the temperature and step size of the perturbation.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n \nMy only concern is that the parameter delta (threshold used to determine in/out distribution) is not discussed much.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] They seem to optimize over this parameter, but this requires access to the out of distribution set prior to the final evaluation.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Could the authors comment on how sensitive the method is to this parameter?[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] How much of the out of distribution dataset is used to determine this value, and what are the effects of this size during tuning?[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] What happens if you set the threshold using one out of distribution dataset and then evaluate on a different one?[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] This seems to be the central part missing to this paper[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] and if the authors are able to address it satisfactorily I will increase my score.
