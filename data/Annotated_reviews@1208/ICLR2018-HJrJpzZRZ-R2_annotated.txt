"This paper is concerned with video prediction, for use in robotic motion planning.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The task is performed on tabletop videos of a robotic arm manipulator interacting with various small objects.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  They use a prior model proposed in Finn et al. 2016, make several incremental architectural improvements, and use an adversarial loss function instead of an L2 loss.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  They also propose a new metric, motion accuracy, which uses the accuracy of the predicted position of the object instead of conventional metrics like PSNR, which is more relevant for robotic motion planning.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThey obtain significant quantitative improvements over the previous 2 papers in this domain (video prediction on tabletop with robotic arm and objects) on both type of metrics - image assessment and motion accuracy.[[RWK-POS,RES-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  They also evaluate realism images using AMT fooling - asking turks to chose the fake between between real and generated images, and obtain substantial improvements on this metric as well.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  \n\nA major point of concern is that they do not use the public dataset proposed in Finn et al. 2016, but use their own (smaller) dataset.[[DAT-NEG,RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  They do not mention whether they train the previous methods on the new dataset, and some of their reported improvements may be because of this.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  They also do not report results on unseen objects, when occlusions are present, and on human motion video prediction, unlike the other papers.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] \n\nThe adversarial loss helps significantly only with AMT fooling or realism of images, as expected because GANs produce sharp images rather than distributions, and is not very relevant for robot motion planning.[[MET-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The incremental architectural changes, different dataset and training are responsible for most of the other improvements."[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]
