"The paper claims to develop a novel method to map natural language queries to SQL.[[INT-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] They claim to have the following contributions: \n\n1. Using a grammar to guide decoding[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n2. Using a new loss function for pointer / copy mechanism.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] For each output token, they aggregate scores for all positions that the output token can be copied from.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nI am confident that point 1 has been used in several previous works.[[MET-NEU], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Although point 2 seems novel, I am not convinced that it is significant enough for ICLR.[[MET-NEU], [APR-NEU,NOV-POS], [DFT], [MAJ]] I was also not sure why there is a need to copy items from the input question, since all SQL query nouns will be present in the SQL table in some form.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]  What will happen if we restrict the copy mechanism to only copy from SQL table.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThe references need work. There are repeated entries for the same reference (one form arxiv and one from conference).[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Please cite the conference version if one is available, many arxiv references have conference versions.[[BIB-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nRebuttal Response: I am still not confident about the significance of contribution 1, so keeping the score the same."[[OAL-NEU], [IMP-NEU,REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]
