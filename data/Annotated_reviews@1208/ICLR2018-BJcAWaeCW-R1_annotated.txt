"The authors try to combine the power of GANs with hierarchical community structure detections.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] While the idea is sound,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] many design choices of the system is questionable.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The problem is particularly aggravated by the poor presentation of the paper, creating countless confusions for readers.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I do not recommend the acceptance of this draft.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\nCompared with GAN, traditional graph analytics is model-specific and non-adaptive to training data.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This is also the case for hierarchical community structures.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] By building the whole architecture on the Louvain method, the proposed method is by no means truly model-agnostic.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In fact, if the layers are fine enough, a significant portion of the network structure will be captured by the sum-up module instead of the GAN modules, rendering the overall behavior dominated by the community detection algorithm.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nThe evaluation remains superficial with minimal quantitative comparisons.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Treating degree distribution and clustering coefficient (appeared as cluster coefficient in draft) as global features is problematic.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  They are merely global average of local topological features which is incapable of capturing true long-distance structures in graphs.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG,TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n\nThe writing of the draft leaves much to be desired.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The description of the architecture is confusing with design choices never clearly explained.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Multiple concepts needs better introduction, including the very name of their model GTI and the idea of stage identification.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Not to mention numerous grammatical errors, I suggest the authors seek professional English writing services."[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
