"The paper attempts to extend the predictive coding model to a multilayer network.[[INT-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  The math is developed for a learning rule, and some demonstrations are shown for reconstructions of CIFAR-10 images.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe overall idea and approach being pursued here is a good one,[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but the model needs further development.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  It could also use better theoretical motivation - i.e., what sorts of representations do you expect to emerge in higher layers?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUB,QSN], [MIN]  Can you demonstrate this with a toy example and then extend to real data?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]\n\nThat the model can reconstruct images per se is not particularly interesting.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]  What we would like to see is that it has somehow learned a more useful or meaningful representation of the data.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]  For example, what do the learned weights look like? [[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN] That would tell you something about what has been learned.\n"[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]
