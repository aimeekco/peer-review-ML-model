"This paper proposed an end-to-end network that generates computer tokens from a single GUI screenshot as input. [[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nEven though the introduced dataset in this paper is interesting, there are some issues:\n- On the model side, this paper used the same architecture as the Karpathy & Fei-Fei (2015).[[RWK-NEG,DAT-POS,MET-NEG,BIB-NEU], [IMP-POS,EMP-NEG], [DIS,CRT], [GEN]] As a result, in my view, the paper has limited novelty and originality.[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [NOV-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- Experiments: The experiments are not enough at all, More specifically, the paper didn't establish any baseline to show the difficulty of this problem and the dataset.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [SMY,DIS], [MIN]] Without a reasonable baseline, it is hard to see how difficult is this dataset and this problem and can't say anything about the significance of this problem in this paper.[[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- The related works: Some recent papers in program synthesis are missing and should have been included in this paper such as:\nRobustFill: Neural Program Learning under Noisy I/O, ICML 2017[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nSome other comments:\n- In the last paragraph of section 3 and first paragraph section 3.1, the authors mentioned that \"...CNN to perform unsupervised feature learning...\"[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. In my view, it is not a correct statement to call the feature extraction from a CNN unsupervised feature learning as the referred CNNs in this paper are trained in a supervised manner and the network in this paper is trained using supervised learning as well.
