"The paper presents some conceptually incremental improvements over the models in \u201cNeural Statistician\u201d and \u201cGenerative matching networks\u201d.[[PDI-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] Nevertheless, it is well written and I think it is solid work with reasonable convincing experiments and good results.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Although, the authors use powerful PixelCNN priors and decoders and they do not really disentangle to what degree their good results rely on the capabilities of these autoregressive components."[[EXP-POS,RES-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
