"In this paper a new neural network architecture for semi-supervised graph classification is proposed.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The new construction builds upon graph polynomial filters and utilizes them on each successive layer of the neural network with ReLU activation functions.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nIn my opinion writing of this paper requires major revision.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The first 8 pages mostly constitute a literature review and experimental section provides no insights about the performance of the TAGCN besides the slight improvement of the Cora, Pubmed and Citeseer benchmarks.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe one layer analysis in sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 is simply an explanation of graph polynomial filters, which were previously proposed and analyzed in cited work of Sandryhaila and Moura (2013).[[RWK-NEG,ANA-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MIN]] Together with the summary of other methods and introduction, it composes the first 8 pages of the paper.[[INT-NEG,MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] I think that the graph polynomial filters can be summarized in much more succinct way and details deferred to the appendix for interested reader.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] I also recommend stating which ideas came from the Sandryhaila and Moura (2013) work in a more pronounced manner.[[PDI-NEU,RWK-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nNext, I disagree with the statement that \"it is not clear how to keep the vertex local property when filtering in the spectrum domain\".[[CNT], [null], [CRT], [MIN]] Graph Laplacian preserves the information about connectivity of the vertices and filtering in the vertex domain can be done via polynomial filters in the Fourier domain. See Eq. 18 and 19 in [1].[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nFinally, I should say that TAGCN idea is interesting.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I think it can be viewed as an extension of the GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2017), where instead of an adjacency matrix with self connections (i.e. first degree polynomial), a higher degree graph polynomial filter is used on every layer (please correct me if this comparison is not accurate).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] With more experiments and interpretation of the model, including some sort of multilayer analysis, this can be a good acceptance candidate.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU,OAL-NEU], [SUB-NEU,REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\n\n[1] David I Shuman, Sunil K Narang, Pascal Frossard, Antonio Ortega, and Pierre Vandergheynst.[[BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\nThe emerging field of signal processing on graphs: Extending high-dimensional data analysis to\nnetworks and other irregular domains.
