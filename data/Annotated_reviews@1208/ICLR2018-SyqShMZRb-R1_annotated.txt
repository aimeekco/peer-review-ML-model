"The paper presents an approach for improving variational autoencoders for structured data that provide an output that is both syntactically valid and semantically reasonable.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The idea presented seems to have merit ,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] however, I found the presentation lacking.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Many sentences are poorly written making the paper hard to read, especially when not familiar with the presented methods.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The experimental section could be organized better.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] I didn't like that two types of experiment are now presented in parallel.[[EXP-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Finally, the paper stops abruptly without any final discussion and/or conclusion.
