"1) This paper proposes a method for learning the sentence representations with sentences dependencies information.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It is more like a dependency-based version skip-thought on the sentence level.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The idea is interesting to me, but I think this paper still needs some improvements.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]] The introduction and related work part are clear with strong motivations to me.[[INT-POS,RWK-POS], [CNT], [APC], [GEN]] But section 4 and 6 need a lot of details. [[CNT], [CNT], [DFT], [GEN]]\n\n2) My comments are as follows:\ni) this paper claims that this is a general sentence embedding method, however, from what has been described in section 3, I think this dependency is only defined in HTML format document.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] What if I only have pure text document without these HTML structure information?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] So I suggest the authors do not claim that this method is a \"general-purpose\" sentence embedding model.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [GEN]]\n\nii) The authors do not have any descriptions for Figure 3.  Equation 1 is also very confusing.[[TNF-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\niii) The experiments are insufficient in terms of details. How is the loss calculated? How is the detection accuracy calculated?[[EXP-NEG], [null], [DFT,QSN], [MIN]]\n"
