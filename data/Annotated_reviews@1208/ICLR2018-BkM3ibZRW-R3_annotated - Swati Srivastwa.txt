"This paper introduces a model for learning robust discrete-space representations with autoencoders.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The proposed method jointly trains an RNN encoder with a GAN to produce latent representations which are designed to better encode similarity in the discrete input space.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  A variety of experiments are conducted that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nGenerally speaking, I like the overall idea, which, as far as I know, is a novel approach for dealing with discrete inputs.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The generated textual samples look good and offer strong support for the model.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  However, I would have preferred to see more quantitative evaluation and less qualitative evaluation, but I understand that doing so is challenging in this domain.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nI will refrain from adding additional detailed commentary in this review because I am unable to judge this paper fairly with respect to other submissions owing to its large deviation from the suggested length limits.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The call for papers states that \"we strongly recommend keeping the paper at 8 pages\", yet the current submission extends well into its 10th page.[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] In addition (and more importantly), the margins appear to have been reduced relative to the standard latex template.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Altogether, it seems like this paper contains a significant amount of additional text beyond what other submissions enjoyed.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] I see no strong reason why this particular paper needed the extra space.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-POS], [CRT], [MIN]] In fact, there are obvious places where the exposition is excessively verbose, and there are clear opportunities to reduce the length of the submission.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] While I fully understand that the length suggestions are not requirements, in my opinion this paper did not make an adequate effort to abide by these suggestions.[[OAL-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Moreover, as a result, I believe this extra length has earned this paper an unfair advantage relative to other submissions, which themselves may have removed important content in order to abide by the length suggestions.[[OAL-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]] As such, I find it difficult or impossible to judge this paper fairly relative to other submissions.[[OAL-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]] I regrettably cannot recommend this paper for acceptance owing to these concerns.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\nThere are many good ideas and experiments in this paper and I would strongly encourage the authors to resubmit this work to a future conference, making sure to reorganize the paper to adhere to the relevant formatting guidelines."[[MET-POS,RES-POS,OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU,EMP-POS], [SUG,APC], [MAJ]]
