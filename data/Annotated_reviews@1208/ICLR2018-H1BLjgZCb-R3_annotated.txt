"The authors of the paper propose a framework to generate natural adversarial examples by searching adversaries in a latent space of dense and continuous data representation (instead of in the original input data space)[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]. The details of their proposed method are covered in Algorithm 1 on Page 12, where an additional GAN (generative adversarial network) I_{\\gamma}, which can be regarded as the inverse function of the original GAN G_{\\theta}, is trained to learn a map from the original input data space to the latent z-space.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors empirically evaluate their method in both image and text domains and claim that the corresponding generated adversaries are natural (legible, grammatical, and semantically similar to the input).[[MET-POS], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nGenerally, I think that the paper is written well (except some issues listed at the end).[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The intuition of the proposed approach is clearly explained and it seems very reasonable to me.[[PDI-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  \nMy main concern, however, is in the current sampling-based search algorithm in the latent z-space, which the authors have already admitted in the paper. The efficiency of such a search method decreases very fast when the dimensions of the z-space increases.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Furthermore, such an approximation solution based on the sampling may be not close to the original optimal solution z* in Equation (3).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]] This makes me feel that there is large room to further advance the paper.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Another concern is that the authors have not provided sufficient number of examples to show the advantages of their proposed method over the other method (such as FGSM) in generating the adversaries.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] The example in Table 1 is very good; but more examples (especially involving the quantitative comparison) are needed to demonstrate the claimed advantages.[[EXP-POS], [SUB-NEG], [APC], [MAJ]] For example, could the authors add such a comparison in Human Evaluation in Section 4 to support the claim that the adversaries generated by their method are more natural?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \n\nOther issues are listed as follows:\n(1). Could you explicitly specify the dimension of the latent z-space in each example in image and text domain in Section 3?[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n(2). In Tables 7 and 8, the human beings agree with the LeNet in >= 58% of cases. Could you still say that your generated \u201cadversaries\u201d leading to the wrong decision from LeNet? [[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]Are these really \u201cadversaries\u201d?[[MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]\n(3). How do you choose the parameter \\lambda in Equation (2)?\n"[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MIN]]
