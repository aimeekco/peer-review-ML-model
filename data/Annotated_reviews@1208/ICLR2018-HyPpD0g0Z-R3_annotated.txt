"This paper aims at robust image classification against adversarial domain shifts.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In the used model, there are two types of latent features, \"core\" features and \"style\" features, and the goal is to achieved by avoiding using the changing style features.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed method, which makes use of grouping information, seems reasonable and useful.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nIt is nice that the authors use \"counterfactual regularization\".[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] But I failed to see a clear, new contribution of using this causal regularization, compared to some of the previous methods to achieve invariance (e.g., relative to translation or rotation).[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG], [APC], [MAJ]] For examples of such methods, one may see the paper \"Transform Invariant Auto-encoder\" (by Matsuo et al.) and references therein.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThe data-generating process for the considered model, given in Figure 2, seems to be consistent with Figure 1 of the paper \"Domain Adaptation with Conditional Transferable Components\" (by Gong et al.). Perhaps the authors can draw the connection between their work and Gong et al.'s work and the related work discussed in that paper.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nBelow are some more detailed comments, In Introduction, it would be nice if the authors made it clear that \"Their high predictive accuracy might suggest that the extracted latent features and learned representations resemble the characteristics our human cognition uses for the task at hand.[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]]\" Why do the features human cognition uses give an optimal predictive accuracy?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] On page 2, the authors claimed that \"These are arguably one reason why deep learning requires large sample sizes as large sample size is clearly not per se a guarantee that the confounding effect will become weaker.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\" Could the authors give more detail on this? A reference would be appreciated. "[[BIB-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
