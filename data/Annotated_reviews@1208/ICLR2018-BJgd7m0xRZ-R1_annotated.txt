"The authors propose a defense against attacks on the security of one-class SVM based anonaly detectors.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The core idea is to perform a random projection of the data (which is supposed to decrease the impact from adversarial distortions). [[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]The approach is empirically tested on the following data: MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is moderately well written and structured.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU,PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Command of related work is ok,[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] but some relevant refs are missing (e.g., Kloft and Laskov, JMLR 2012).[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  The empirical results actually confirm that indeed the strategy of reducing the dimensionality using random projections reduces the impact from adversarial distortions.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  This is encouraging.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  What the paper really lacks in my opinion is a closer analysis of *why* the proposed approach works, i.e., a qualitative empirical analysis (toy experiment?)  or theoretical justification.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEU,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Right now, there is no theoretical justification for the approach, nor even a (in my opinion) convincing movitation/Intuition behind the approach.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Also, the attack model should formally introduced.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nIn summary, I d like to encourage the authors to further investigate into their approach, but I am not convinced by the manuscript in the current form.[[MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It lacks both in sound theoretical justification and intuitive motivation of the approach.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The experiments, however, show clearly advantages of the approach [[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]](again, here further experiments are necessary, e.g., varying the dose of adversarial points).
