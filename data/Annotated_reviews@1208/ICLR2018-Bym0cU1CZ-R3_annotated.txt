"The paper describes a technique to incorporate dialog acts into neural conversational agents.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  This is very interesting work. [[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] Existing techniques for neural conversational agents essentially mimic the data in large corpora of message-response pairs and therefore do not use any notion of dialog act.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]]  A very important type of dialog act is \"switching topic\", often done to ensure that the conversation will continue. [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] The paper describes a classifier that predicts the dialog act of the next utterance.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]  The next utterance is then generated based on this dialog act.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]  The paper also describes how to increase the relevance of responses and the length of conversations by self reinforcement learning. This is also very interesting.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The paper is also well written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  I do not have any suggestion for improvement.  This is good work that should be published.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]"
