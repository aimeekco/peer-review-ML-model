"This paper proposed a framework to connect the solving of GAN with finding the saddle point of a minimax problem.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nAs a result, the primal-dual subgradient methods can be directly introduced to calculate the saddle point.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nAdditionally, this idea not only fill the relatviely lacking of theoretical results for GAN or WGAN, but also provide a new perspective to modify the GAN-type models.[[PDI-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nBut this saddle point model reformulation  in section 2 is quite standard, with limited theoretical analysis in Theorem 1.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nAs follows, the resulting algorithm 1 is also standard primal-dual method for a saddle point problem.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nMost important I think, the advantage of considering GAN-type model as a saddle point model is that first--order methods can be designed to solve it.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] But the numerical experiments part seems to be a bit weak, because the MINST or CIFAR-10 dataset is not large enough to test the extensibility for large-scale cases.
