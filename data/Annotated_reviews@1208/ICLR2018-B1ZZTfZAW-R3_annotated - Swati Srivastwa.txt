"This paper proposes to use RGANs and RCGANS to generate synthetic sequences of actual data.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  They demonstrate the quality of the sequences on sine waves, MNIST, and ICU telemetry data.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MIN]] \n\nThe authors demonstrate novel approaches for generating real-valued sequences using adversarial training, a train on synthetic, test of real and vice versa method for evaluating GANS, generating synthetic medical time series data, and an empirical privacy analysis.[[EXP-NEU,MET-POS,ANA-NEU], [NOV-POS], [SMY,APC], [MAJ]]  \n\nMajor\n- the medical use case is not motivating.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  de-identifying the 4 telemetry measures is extremely easy and there is little evidence to show that it is even possible to reidentify individuals using these 4 measures.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] our institutional review board would certainly allow self-certification of the data (i.e. removing the patient identifiers and publishing the first 4 hours of sequences).[[DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- the labels selected by the authors for the icu example are to forecast the next 15 minutes and whether a critical value is reached.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Please add information about how this critical value was generated.[[DAT-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Also it would be very useful to say that a physician was consulted and that the critical values were \"clinically\" useful.[[ANA-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]\n- the changes in performance of TSTR are large enough that I would have difficulty trusting any experiments using the synthetic data.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] If I optimized a method using this synthetic data, I would still need to assess the result on real data.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- In addition it is unclear whether this synthetic process would actually generate results that are clinically useful.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The authors certainly make a convincing statement about the internal validity of the method.[[MET-POS], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] An externally valid measure would strengthen the results.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] I'm not quite sure how the authors could externally validate the synthetic data as this would also require generating synthetic outcome measures.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] I think it would be possible for the synthetic sequence to also generate an outcome measure (i.e. death) based on the first 4 hours of stay.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nMinor\n- write in the description for table 1 what task the accuracies correspond.[[TNF-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nSummary\nThe authors present methods for generating synthetic sequences.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The MNIST example is compelling.[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However the ICU example has some pitfalls which need to be addressed."[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
