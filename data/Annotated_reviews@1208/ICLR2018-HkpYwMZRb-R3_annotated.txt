"The paper makes some bold claims.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MAJ]] In particular about commonly accepted intuition for avoiding exploding/vanishing gradients and why all the recent bag of tricks (BN, Adam) do not actually address the problems they set out to alleviate.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nThis is either a very important paper or the analysis is incorrect but it's not my area of expertise.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Actually understanding it at depth and validating the proofs and validity of the experiments will require some digestion.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] It's possible some of the issues arise from the particular architectures they choose to investigate and demonstrate on (eg I have mostly seen ResNets in the context of CNNs but they analyze on FC topologies, the form of the loss, etc) but that's a guess and there are some further analysis in the supp material for these networks which I haven't looked at in detail.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \n\nRegardless - an important note to the authors is that it's a particularly long and verbose paper, coming in at 16 pages of the main paper(!) with nearly 50 (!) pages of supplementary material where the heart and meat of the proofs and experiments reside.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] As such it's not even clear if this is proper for a conference.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]] The authors have already provided several pages worth of additional comments on the website on further related work.[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] I view this as an issue in and of itself.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Being succinct and applying rigour in editing is part of doing science and reporting findings, and a wise guideline to follow.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] While the authors may claim it's necessary to use that much space to make their point I will argue that this length is uncalibrated to standards.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I've seen many papers that need to go through much more complicated derivations and theory and remain within a 8-10 page limit by being precise and strictly to the point.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Perhaps Godel could be a good inspiration here, with a 21 page PhD thesis that fundamentally changed mathematics.[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nIn addition to being quite bold in claims, it is also somewhat confrontational in style.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] I understand the authors are trying to make a very serious claim about much of the common wisdom, but again, having reviewed papers for many years, this is highly unusual and it is questionable whether it is necessary. [[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nSo, while I cannot vouch for the correctness, I think it can and should go through a serious revision to make it succinct and that will likely considerably help in making it accessible to a wider readership and aligned to the expectations from a conference paper in the field.
