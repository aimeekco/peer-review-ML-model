"\nSummary: the paper proposes an idea for multi-task learning where tasks have shared dependencies between subtasks as task graph.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed framework, task graph solver (NTS), consists of many approximation steps and representations: CNN to capture environment states, task graph parameterization, logical operator approximation; the idea of reward-propagation policy helps pre-training.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The framework is evaluated on a relevant multi-task problem.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nIn general, the paper proposes an idea to tackle an interesting problem.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] It is well written, the idea is well articulated and presented.[[PDI-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The idea to represent task graphs are quite interesting.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However it looks like the task graph itself is still simple and has limited representation power.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Specifically, it poses just little constraints and presents no stochasticity (options result in stochastic outcomes).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThe method is evaluated in one experiment with many different settings.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] The task itself is not too complex which involves 10 objects, and a small set of deterministic options[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]. It might be only complex when the number of dependency layer is large.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] However, it's still more convinced if the paper method is demonstrated in more domains.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n\nAbout the description of problem statement in Section 3:[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\n- How the MDP M and options are defined, e.g. transition functions, are tochastic?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n- What is the objective of the problem in section 3[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nRelated work: many related work in robotics community on the topic of task and motion planning (checkout papers in RSS, ICRA, IJRR, etc.) should also be discussed."[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
