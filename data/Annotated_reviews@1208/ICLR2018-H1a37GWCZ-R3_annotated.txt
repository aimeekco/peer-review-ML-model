"This paper extends the idea of forming an unsupervised representation of sentences used in the SkipThought approach by using a broader set of evidence for forming the representation of a sentence.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Rather than simply encoding the preceding sentence and then generating the next sentence, the model suggests that a whole bunch of related \"sentences\" could be encoded, including document title, section title, footnotes, hyperlinked sentences.This is a valid good idea and indeed improves results.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] The other main new and potentially useful idea is a new idea for handling OOVs in this context where they are represented by positional placeholder variables. This also seems helpful.[[PDI-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] The paper is able to show markedly better results on paraphrase detection that skipthought and some interesting and perhaps good results on domain-specific coreference resolution.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]]\n\nOn the negative side, the model of the paper isn't very excitingly different. It's a fairly straightforward extension of the earlier SkipThought model to a situation where you have multiple generators of related text. [[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]There isn't a clear evaluation that shows the utility of the added OOV Handler, since the results with and without that handling aren't comparable.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The OOV Handler is also related to positional encoding ideas that have been used in NMT but aren't reference.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MIN]] And the coreference experiment isn't that clearly described nor necessarily that meaningful.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] Finally, the finding of dependencies between sentences for the multiple generators is done in a rule-based fashion, which is okay and works, but not super neural and exciting.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nOther comments:\n - p.3. Another related sentence you could possibly use is first sentence of paragraph related to all other sentences? (Works if people write paragraphs with a \"topic sentence\" at the beginning.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS,QSN], [MIN]]\n - p.5. Notation seemed a bit non-standard. I thought most people use \\sigma for a sigmoid (makes sense, right?), whereas you use it for a softmax and use calligraphic S for a sigmoid.[[CNT], [CLA-NEU], [DFT,DIS], [MIN]]...\n - p.5. Section 5 suggests the standard way to do OOVs is to average all word vectors. That's one well-know way, but hardly the only way. A trained UNK encoding and use of things like character-level encoders is also quite common.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT,DIS], [MIN]]\n - p.6. The basic idea of the OOV encoder seems a good one. In domain specific contexts, you want to be able to refer to and re-use words that appear in related sentences, since they are likely to appear again and you want to be able to generate them.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [GEN]] A weakness of this section however is that it makes no reference to related work whatsoever. It seems like there's quite a bit of related work.[[RWK-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MIN]] The idea of using a positional encoding so that you can generate rare words by position has previously been used in NMT, e.g. Luong et al. (Google brain) (ACL 2015).[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] More generally, a now quite common way to handle this problem is to use \"pointing\" or \"copying\", which appears in a number of papers. (e.g., Vinyals et al. 2015) and might also have been used here and might be expected to work too.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \n - p.7. Why such an old Wikipedia dump? Most people use a more recent one!\[[CNT], [null], [DIS,QSN], [MIN]]n - p.7. The paraphrase results seem good and prove the idea works. It's a shame they don't let you see the usefulness of the OOV model.[[RWK-NEG], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n - p.8. For various reasons, the coreference results seem less useful than they could have been,[[RES-NEG], [null], [DFT], [GEN]] but they do show some value for the technique in the area of domain-specific coreference.\n\n"[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [DIS], [GEN]]
