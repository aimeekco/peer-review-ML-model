"The paper proposes a neural architecture to map video streams to a discrete collection of objects, without human annotations, using an unsupervised pixel reconstruction loss.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]   The paper uses such object representation to inform state representation for reinforcement learning.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]   Each object is described by a position, appearance feature and confidence of existence (presence).[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]   The proposed network predicts a 2D mask image, where local maxima  correspond to object locations, and values of the maxima correspond to presence values.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]   The paper uses a hard decision on the top-k objects (there can be at most k objects) in the final object list, based on the soft object presence values (I have not understood if these top k are sampled based on the noisy presence values or are thresholded, if the authors could kindly clarify).[[PDI-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]    \n The final presence values though are sampled using Gumbell-softmax.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  \n\nObjects are matched across consecutive frames using non parametric (not learnable) deterministic matching functions, that takes into account the size and appearance of the objects.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]   \n\nFor the unsupervised reconstruction loss, a static background is populated with objects, one at a time, each passing its state and feature through deconvolution layers to generate RGB object content.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  \n\nThen a policy network is trained with deep Q learning whose architecture takes into account the objects in the scene, in an order agnostic way, and pairwise features are captured between pairs of objects, using similar layers as visual interaction nets.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  \n\nPros\nThe paper presents interesting ideas regarding unsupervised object discovery\[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  n\nCons:\nThe paper shows no results.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]   The objects discovered could be discovered with mosaicing (since the background is static) and background subtraction. \n"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
