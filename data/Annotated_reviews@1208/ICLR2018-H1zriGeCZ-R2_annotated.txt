"- algorithm 1 has a lot of problem specific hyperparametes that may be difficult to get right[[MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. Not clear how important they are\n- they analyze the simpler (analytically and likely computationally) Boolean hyperparameter case (each hyperparameter is binary).[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Not a realistic setting.[[PDI-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] In their experiments they use these binary parameter spaces so I'm not sure how much I buy that it is straightforward to use continuous valued polynomials.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] \n- interesting idea but I think it's more theoretical than practical.[[PDI-POS,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Feels like a hammer in need of a nail.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] "
