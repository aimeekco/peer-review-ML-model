"The paper discusses a method for adjusting image embeddings in order tease apart technical variation from biological signal.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A loss function based on the Wasserstein distance is used. \nThe paper is interesting[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] but could certainly do with more explanations.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]] \n\nComments:\n1. It is difficult for the reader to understand a) why Wasserstein is used "[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]and b) how exactly the nuisance variation is reduced."[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\nA dedicated section on motivation is missing.`[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\n2. Does the Deep Metric network always return a '64-dim' vector?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \nHave you checked your model using different length vectors?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\n3. Label the y-axis in Fig 2.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n4. The fact that you have early-stopping as opposed to a principled regularizer also requires further substantiation.
