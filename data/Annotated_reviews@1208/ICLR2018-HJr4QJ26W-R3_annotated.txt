"This paper proposes a technique to improve the output of GANs by maximising a separate score that aims to mimic human interactions.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nSummary:\nThe goal of the technique to involve human interaction in generative processes is interesting.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The proposed addition of a new loss function for this purpose is an obvious choice, not particularly involved.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] It is unclear to me whether the paper has value in its current form, that is without experimental results for the task it achieves.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It feels to premature for publication.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n\nMore comments:\nThe main problem with this paper is that the proposed systems is designed for a human interaction setting but no such experiment is done or presented.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] The title is misleading, this may be the direction where the authors of the submission want to go, but the title  \u201c.. with human interactions\u201d is clearly misleading.[[CNT], [CNT], [CRT], [MAJ]] \u201cModel of human interactions\u201d may be more appropriate.[[CNT], [CNT], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nThe technical idea of this paper is to introduce a separate score in the GAN training process.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This modifies the generator objective.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  Besides \u201cfooling\u201d the discriminator, the generator objective is to maximise user interaction with the generated batch of images.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  This is an interesting objective but since no interactive experiments presented in this paper,[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  the rest of the experiments hinges on the definition of \u201cPIR\u201d (positive interaction rate)using a model of human interaction.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Instead of real interactions, the submission proposes to maximise the activations of hidden units in a separate neural network.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  By choosing the hierarchy level and type of filter the results of the GAN differ.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]  \n\nI could not appreciate the results in Figure 2 since I was missing the definition of PIR, how it is drawn in the training setup.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Further I found it not surprising that the PIR changes when a highly parameterised model is trained for this task.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  The PIR value comes from a separate network not directly accessible during training time, nonetheless I would have been surprised to not see an increase.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Please comment in the rebuttal and I would appreciate if the details of the synthetic PIR values on the training set could be explained.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \n\n- Technically it was a bit unclear to me how the objective is defined.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  There is a PIR per level and filter (as defined in C4) but in the setup the L_{PIR} was mentioned to be a scalar function, how are the values then summarized?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  There is a PIR per level and feature defined in C4.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  \n- What does the PIR with the model in Section 3 stand for?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Shouldn\u2019t be something like \u201cuniqueness\u201d, that is how unique is an image in a batch of images be a better indicator?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  Besides, the intent of what possibly interesting PIR examples will be was unclear.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \nE.g., the statement at the end of 2.1 is unclear at that point in the document. [[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] How is the PIR drawn exactly?[[EXP-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]  What does it represent?[[EXP-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  Is there a PIR per image?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  It becomes clear later, but I suggest to revisit this description in a new version.[[CNT], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n- Also I suggest to move more details from Section C4 into the main text in Section 3.[[CNT], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  The high level description in Section 3. \n"[[CNT], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
