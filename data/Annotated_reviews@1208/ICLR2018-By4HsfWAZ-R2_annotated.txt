"In this paper, the authors show how a Deep Learning model for sea surface temperature prediction can be designed to incorporate the classical advection diffusion model.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The architecture includes a differentiable warping scheme which allows back propagation of the error and is inspired by the fundamental solution of the PDE model. [[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]They evaluate the suggested model on synthetic data and outperform the current state of the art in terms of accuracy.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\npros\n- the paper is written in a clear and concise manner[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- it suggests an interesting connection between a traditional model and Deep Learning techniques\[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-POS], [SUG], [GEN]]n- in the experiments they trained the network on 64 x 64 patches and achieved convincing results[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\ncons\n- please provide the value of the diffusion coefficient for the sake of reproducibility[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- medium resolution of the resulting prediction[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n\nI enjoyed reading this paper and would like it to be accepted.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\nminor comments:\n- on page five in the last paragraph there is a left parenthesis missing in the inline formula nabla dot w_t(x))^2.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- on page nine in the last paragraph there is the word 'flow' missing: '.. estimating the optical [!] between 2 [!] images.'[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- in the introduction (page two) the authors refer to SST prediction as a 'relatively complex physical modeling problem', whereas in the conclusion (page ten) it is referred to as 'a problem of intermediate complexity'. This seems to be inconsistent."[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
