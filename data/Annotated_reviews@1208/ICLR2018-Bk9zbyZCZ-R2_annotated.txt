"This paper presents a fully differentiable neural architecture for mapping and path planning for navigation in previously unseen environments, assuming near perfect* relative localization provided by velocity.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The model is more general than the cognitive maps (Gupta et al, 2017) and builds on the NTM/DNC or related architectures (Graves et al, 2014, 2016, Rae et al, 2017) thanks to the 2D spatial structure of the associative memory.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] Basically, it consists of a 2D-indexed grid of features (the map) M_t that can be summarized at each time point into read vector r_t, and used for extracting a context c_t for the current agent state s_t, compute (thanks to an LSTM/GRU) an updated write vector w_{t+1}^{x,y} at the current position and update the map using that write vector.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The position {x,y} is a binned representation of discrete or continuous coordinates.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The absolute coordinate map can be replaced by a relative ego-centric map that is shifted (just like in Gupta et al, 2017) as the agent moves.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe experiments are exhaustive and include remembering the goal location with or without cues (similarly to Mirowski et al, 2017, not cited) in simple mazes of size 4x4 up to 8x8 in the 3D Doom environment.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-POS,BIB-NEG], [CMP-NEU,EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] The most important aspect is the capability to build a feature map of previously unseen environments.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nThis paper, showing excellent and important work, has already been published on arXiv 9 months ago and widely cited.[[RWK-NEU], [NOV-NEG], [DIS], [GEN]] It has been improved since, through different sets of experiments and apparently a clearer presentation,[[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but the ideas are the same.[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] I wonder how it is possible that the paper has not been accepted at ICML or NIPS (assuming that it was actually submitted there).[[OAL-POS], [APR-POS], [DIS], [MAJ]] What are the motivations of the reviewers who rejected the paper - are they trying to slow down competing research, or are they ignorant, and is the peer review system broken?[[EXT-NEG], [null], [QSN], [MIN]] I quite like the formulation of the NIPS ratings: \"if this paper does not get accepted, I am considering boycotting the conference\".[[EXT-NEG], [null], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\n* The noise model experiment in Appendix D is commendable, [[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]but the noise model is somewhat unrealistic (very small variance, zero mean Gaussian) and assumes only drift in x and y, not along the orientation.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] While this makes sense in grid world environments or rectilinear mazes, it does not correspond to realistic robotic navigation scenarios with wheel skid, missing measurements, etc... [[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]Perhaps showing examples of trajectories with drift added would help convince the reader (there is no space restriction in the appendix)."[[DAT-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
