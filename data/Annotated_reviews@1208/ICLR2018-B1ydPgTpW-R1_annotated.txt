"The author(s) proposed to use a deep bidirectional recurrent neural network to estimate the auction price of license plates based on the sequence of letters and digits.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The method uses a learnable character embedding to transform the data, but is an end-to-end approach[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. The analysis of squared error for the price regression shows a clear advantage of the method over previous models that used hand crafted features.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS,ANA-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \nHere are my concerns:\n1) As the price shows a high skewness in Fig. 1, it may make more sense to use relative difference instead of absolute difference of predicted and actual auction price in evaluating/training each model.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [MAJ]] That is, making an error of $100 for a plate that is priced $1000 has a huge difference in meaning to that for a plate priced as $10,000. [[ANA-NEU,EXT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\n2) The time-series data seems to have a temporal trend which makes retraining beneficial as suggested by authors in section 7.2.[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] If so, the evaluation setting of dividing data into three *random* sets of training, validation, and test, in 5.3 doesn't seem to be the right and most appropriate choice.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It should however, be divided into sets corresponding to non-overlapping time intervals to avoid the model use of temporal information in making the prediction.
