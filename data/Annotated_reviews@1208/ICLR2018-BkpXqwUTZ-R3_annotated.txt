"The paper is incomplete and nowhere near finished, it should have been withdrawn[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]. \n\nThe theoretical results are presented in a bitmap figure and only referred to in the text (not explained),[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] and  the results on datasets are not explained either (and pretty bad). A waste of my time."[[DAT-NEU,RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
