"This paper introduces a conditional variant of the model defined in the Neural Statistician (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02185).[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The generative model defines the process that produces the dataset.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This model is first a mixture over contexts followed by i.i.d. generation of the dataset with possibly some unobserved random variable.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This corresponds to a mixture of Neural Statisicians.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors suggest that such a model could help with disentangling factors of variation in data.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In the experiments they only consider training the model with the context selection variable and the data variables observed.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nUnfortunately there is minimal quantitative evaluation (visualizing 264 MNIST samples is not enough).[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The only quantitative evaluation is in Table 1, and it seems the model is not able to generalize reliably to all rotations and all digits.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG,TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Clearly, we can't expect perfect performance, but there are some troubling results: 5.2 accuracy on non-rotated 0s, 0.0 accuracy on non-rotated 6s.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Every digit has at least one rotation that is not well classified, so this section could use more discussion and analysis.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, how would this metric classify VAE samples with contexts corresponding only to digit type (no rotations)? How would this metric classify vanilla VAE samples that are hand labeled?[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Moreover, the context selection variable \"a\" should be considered part of the dataset, and as such the paper should report how \"a\" was selected.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]\n\nThis model is a relatively simple extension of the Neural Statistician, so the novelty of the idea is not enough to counterbalance the lack of quantitative evaluation.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] I do think the idea is well-motivated, and represents a promising way to incorporate prior knowledge of concepts into our training of VAEs.[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Still, the paper as it stands is not complete, and I encourage the authors to followup with more thorough quantitative empirical evaluations.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG],[DFT,SUG], [MAJ]]
