"The paper proposed a novel regularizer that is to be applied to the (rectifier) discriminators in GAN in order to encourage a better allocation of the \"model capacity\" of the discriminators over the (potentially multi-modal) generated / real data points, which might in turn helps with learning a more faithful generator.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is in general very well written, with intuitions and technical details well explained and empirical studies carefully designed and executed.[[MET-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSome detailed comments / questions:[[OAL-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\n1. It seems the concept of \"binarized activation patterns\", which the proposed regularizer is designed upon, is closely coupled with rectifier nets.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] I would therefore suggest the authors to highlight this assumption / constraint more clearly e.g. in the abstract.[[ABS-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n2. In order for the paper to be more self-contained, maybe list at least once the formula for \"rectifier net\" (sth. like \"a^T max(0, wx + b) + c\") ?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] This might also help the readers better understand where the polytopes in Figure 1 come from.[[TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\n3. In section 3.1, when presenting random variables (U_1, ..., U_d), I find the word \"Bernourlli\" a bit misleading because typically people would expect U_i to take values from {0, 1} whereas here you assume {-1, +1}.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This can be made clear with just one sentence yet would greatly help with clearing away confusions for subsequent derivations.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\nAlso, \"K\" is already used to denote the mini-batch size, so it's a slight abuse to reuse \"k\" to denote the \"kth marginal\".[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n4. In section 3.2, it may be clearer to explicitly point out the use of the \"3-sigma\" rule for Gaussian distributions here.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] But I don't find it justified anywhere why \"leave 99.7% of i, j pairs unpenalized\" is sth.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] to be sought for here?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\n5. In section 3.3, when presenting Corollary 3.3 of Gavinsky & Pudlak (2015), \"n\" abruptly appears without proper introduction / context.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n6. For the empirical study with 2D MoG, would an imbalanced mixture make it harder for the BRE-regularized GAN to escape from modal collapse?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\n7. Figure 3 is missing the sub-labels (a), (b), (c), (d).[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]"
