"\nSummary of the paper\n-------------------------------\n\nThe authors propose to add 4 elements to the 'FederatedAveraging' algorithm to provide a user-level differential privacy guarantee.[[MET-NEU], [Null], [SMY], [GEN]] The impact of those 4 elements on the model'a accuracy and privacy is then carefully analysed.[[ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nClarity, Significance and Correctness\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nClarity: Excellent[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSignificance: I'm not familiar with the literature of differential privacy, so I'll let more knowledgeable reviewers evaluate this point.[[MET-NEU,EXT-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nCorrectness: The paper is technically correct.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nQuestions\n--------------\n\n1. Figure 1: Adding some noise to the updates could be view as some form of regularization, so I have trouble understand why the models with noise are less efficient than the baseline.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [QSN,CRT], [MIN]]\n2. Clipping is supposed to help with the exploding gradients problem.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Do you have an idea why a low threshold hurts the performances?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is it because it reduces the amplitude of the updates (and thus simply slows down the training)?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n3. Is your method compatible with other optimizers, such as RMSprop or ADAM (which are commonly used to train RNNs)?[[RWK-NEU, MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU, EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nPros\n------\n\n1. Nice extensions to FederatedAveraging to provide privacy guarantee.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n2. Strong experimental setup that analyses in details the proposed extensions.[[EXP-POS,MET-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n3. Experiments performed on public datasets.[[DAT-POS,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons\n-------\n\nNone[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nTypos\n--------\n\n1. Section 2, paragraph 3 : \"is given in Figure 1\" -> \"is given in Algorithm 1\"\n\n[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]Note\n-------\n\nSince I'm not familiar with the differential privacy literature, I'm flexible with my evaluation based on what other reviewers with more expertise have to say."[[EXT-NEU,OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [GEN]]
