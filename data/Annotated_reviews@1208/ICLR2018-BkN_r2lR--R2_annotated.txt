"The paper presents a method for finding related images (analogies) from different domains based on matching-by-synthesis.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The general idea is interesting and the results show improvements over previous approaches, such as CycleGAN (with different initializations, pre-learned or not).[[RWK-NEU,PDI-POS,RES-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The algorithm is tested on three datasets.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nWhile the approach has some strong positive points, such as good experiments and theoretical insights (the idea to match by synthesis and the proposed loss which is novel, and combines the proposed concepts),;[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] the paper lacks clarity and sufficient details.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nInstead of the longer intro and related work discussion,;[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MAJ]] I would prefer to see a Figure with the architecture and more illustrative examples to show that the insights are reflected in the experiments.[[EXP-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Also, the matching part, which is discussed at the theoretical level, could be better explained and presented at a more visual level.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] It is hard to understand sufficiently well what the formalism means without more insigh[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]t.\n\nAlso, the experiments need more details. For example, it is not clear what the numbers in Table 2 mean.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n\n\n"
