"An unsupervised approach is proposed to build bilingual dictionaries without parallel corpora, by aligning the monolingual word embeddings spaces, i.a. via adversarial learning.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper is very well-written and makes for a rather pleasant read, save for some need for down-toning the claims to novelty as voiced in the comment re: Ravi & Knight (2011) or simply in general:[[INT-POS,RWK-NEG], [CLA-POS,NOV-NEG], [SUG,DFT,DIS], [GEN]] it's a very nice paper, I enjoy reading it *in spite*, and not *because* of the text sales-pitching itself at times[[INT-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]].\n\nThere are some gaps in the awareness of the related work in the sub-field of bilingual lexicon induction, e.g. the work by Vulic & Moens (2016).\[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]n\nThe evaluation is for the most part intrinsic, and it would be nice to see the approach applied downstream beyond the simplistic task of English-Esperanto translation: plenty of outlets out there for applying multilingual word embeddings.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY,SUG], [GEN]] Would be nice to see at least some instead of the plethora of intrinsic evaluations of limited general interest.[[PDI-NEG,ANA-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nIn my view, to conclude, this is still a very nice paper, so I vote clear accept, in hope to see these minor flaws filtered out in the revision."[[INT-POS,RWK-NEG], [CLA-POS,APR-POS], [APC,FBK], [MAJ]]
