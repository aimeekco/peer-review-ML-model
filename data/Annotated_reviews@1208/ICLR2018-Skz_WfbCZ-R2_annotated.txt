"This paper provides a new generalization bound for feed forward networks based on a PAC-Bayesian analysis.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The generalization bound depends on the spectral norm of the layers and the Frobenius norm of the weights.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The resulting generalization bound is similar (though not comparable) to a recent result of Bartlett et al (2017),[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] however the technique is different since this submission uses PAC-Bayesian analysis.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The resulting proof is more simple and streamlined compared to that of Bartlett et al (2017).[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe paper is well presented, the result is explained and compared to other results, and the proofs seem correct.[[MET-POS,RES-POS,OAL-POS], [PNF-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The result is not particularly different from previous ones,[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] but the different proof technique might be a good enough reason to accept this paper.[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MIN]] \n\n\n\n\nTypos: Several citations are unparenthesized when they should be.[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]] Also, after equation (6) there is a reference command that is not compiled properly.\n\n"[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
