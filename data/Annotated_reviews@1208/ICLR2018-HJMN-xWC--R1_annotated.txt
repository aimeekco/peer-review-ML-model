"There is a vast literature on structure learning for constructing neural networks (topologies, layers, learning rates, etc.) in an automatic fashion.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Your work falls under a similar category.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] I am a bit surprised that you have not discussed it in the paper not to mention provided a baseline to compare your method to.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] Also, without knowing intricate details about each of 17 tasks you mentioned it is really hard to make any judgement as to how significant is improvement coming from your approach.[[MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] There has been some work done on constructing interpretable neural networks, such as stimulated training in speech recognition, unfortunately these are not discussed in the paper despite interpretability being considered important in this paper.
