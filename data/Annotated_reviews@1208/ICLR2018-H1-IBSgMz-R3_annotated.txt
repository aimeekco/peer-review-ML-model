"It is hard to interpret this work as the authors do not mention the original work by Gutmann and his colleague on the NCE in the required details.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Their paper provides a proof that in the non-parametric case the optimum on NCE objective function is at the data distribution with normalisation constant either learned or held fixed (0 or any value you like).[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] What exactly is the purpose of this paper? [[OAL-NEU], [null], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\nThere are a number of minor issues as well. In language modelling we do not compute normalisation term during NCE training or testing as explicitly stated by the authors you are referring to (Chen 2016) - that is the whole point of using NCE.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] What is p(c) in equation 4 and where it comes from?"[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]
