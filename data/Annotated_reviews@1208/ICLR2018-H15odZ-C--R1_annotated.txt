"The paper concerns distributions used for the code space in implicit models, e.g. VAEs and GANs.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]The authors analyze the relation between the latent space dimension and the normal distribution which is commonly used for the latent distribution.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEU,CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] The well-known fact that probability mass concentrates in a shell of hyperspheres as the dimensionality grows is used to argue for the normal distribution being sub-optimal when interpolating between points in the latent space with straight lines.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]To correct this, the authors propose to use a Gamma-distribution for the norm of the latent space (and uniform angle distribution).[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] This results in more mass closer to the origin, and the authors show both that the midpoint distribution is natural in terms of the KL divergence to the data points, and experimentally that the method gives visually appealing interpolations.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]] \n\n While the contribution of using a standard family of distributions in a standard implicit model setup is limited, the paper does make interesting observations, analyses and an attempt to correct the interpolation issue. [[RWK-POS,PDI-POS,DAT-POS,EXP-POS,MET-NEG,ANA-POS], [SUB-POS,IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [SMY,APC], [MAJ]]The paper is clearly written and presents the theory and experimental results nicely.[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I find that the paper can be accepted but the incremental nature of the contribution prevents a higher score."[[EXT-POS], [null], [FBK], [MAJ]]
