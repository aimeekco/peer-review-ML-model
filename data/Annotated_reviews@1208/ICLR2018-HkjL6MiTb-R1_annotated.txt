"This paper introduces siamese neural networks to the competing risks framework of Fine and Gray.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]The authors optimize for the c-index by minimizing a loss function driven by the cumulative risk of competing risk m and correct ordering of comparable pairs.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] While the idea of optimizing directly for the c-index directly is a good one (with an approximation and with useful complementary loss function terms),[[PDI-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] the paper leaves something to be desired in quality and clarity.[[RWK-NEG], [CLA-NEG,SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nRelated works:\n- For your consideration: is multi-task survival analysis effectively a competing risks model, except that these models also estimate risk after the first competing event (i.e. in a competing risks model the rates for other events simply go to 0 or near-zero)? Please discuss.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,DIS], [MIN]] Also, if the claim is that there are not deep learning survival analyses, please see, e.g. Jing and Smola.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [REC-NEU], [SUG], [GEN]]\n- It would be helpful to define t_k explicitly to alleviate determining whether it is the interval time between ordered events or the absolute time since t_0 (it's the latter).[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [GEN]] Consider calling k a time index instead of t_k a time interval (\"subject x experiences cause m occurs [sic] in a time interval t_k\")\n- Line after eq 8: do you mean accuracy term?[[RWK-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]\n- I would not call Reg a regularization term since it is not shrinking the coefficients[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. It is a term to minimize a risk not a parameter[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]].\n- You claim to adjust for event imbalance and time interval imbalance but this is not mathematically shown nor documented in the experiments.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n- The results show only one form of comparison, and the results have confidence intervals that overlap with at least one competing method in all tasks."[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
