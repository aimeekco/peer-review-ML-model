"This paper examines the nature of convolutional filters in the encoder and a decoder of a VAE, and a generator and a discriminator of a GAN.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors treat the inputs (X) and outputs (Y) of each filter throughout each step of the convolving process as a time series, which allows them to do a Discrete Time Fourier Transform analysis of the resulting sequences.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] By comparing the power spectral density of the input and the output, they get a Spectral Dependency Ratio (SDR) ratio that characterises a filter as spectrally independent (neutral), correlating (amplifies certain frequencies), or anti-correlating (dampens frequencies).[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This analysis is performed in the context of the Independence of Cause and Mechanism (ICM) framework.[[ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors claim that their analysis demonstrates a different characterisation of the inference/discriminator and generative networks in VAE and GAN, whereby the former are anti-causal and the latter are causal in line with the ICM framework.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They also claim that this analysis can be used to improve the performance of the models.[[ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nPros:\n-- SDR characterisation of the convolutional filters is interesting[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n-- The authors show that filters with different characteristics are responsible for different aspects of image modelling[[RES-NEU], [null], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]\n\nCons:\n-- The authors do not actually demonstrate how their analysis can be used to improve VAEs or GANs[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n-- Their proposed SDR analysis does not actually find much difference between the generator and the discriminator of the GAN[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n-- The clarity of the writing could be improved (e.g. the discussion in section 3.1 seems inaccurate in the current form).[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] Grammatical and spelling mistake are frequent.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] More background information could be helpful in section 2.2.[[CNT], [SUB-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] All figures (but in particular Figure 3) need more informative captions[[TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]\n-- The authors talk a lot about disentangling in the introduction, but this does not seem to be followed up in the rest of the text.[[INT-NEG,OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Furthermore, they are missing a reference to beta-VAE (Higgins et al, 2017) when discussing VAE-based approaches to disentangled factor learning[[BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n\nIn summary, the paper is not ready for publication in its current form.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]] The authors are advised to use the insights from their proposed SDR analysis to demonstrate quantifiable improvements the VAEs/GANs."[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
