"The paper presents a multi-modal CNN model for sentiment analysis that combines images and text.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The model is trained on a new dataset collected from Tumblr.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nPositive aspects:\n+ Emphasis in model interpretability and its connection to psychological findings in emotions[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n+ The idea of using Tumblr data seems interesting, allowing to work with a large set of emotion categories, instead of considering just the binary task positive vs. negative.[[PDI-POS,DAT-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\ \n\nWeaknesses:\n- A deeper analysis of previous work on the combination of image and text for sentiment analysis (both datasets and methods) and its relation with the presented work is necessary.[[RWK-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\ \n- The proposed method is not compared with other methods that combine text and image for sentiment analysis.[[RWK-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n-  The study is limited to just one dataset.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe paper presents interesting ideas and findings in an important challenging area.[[PDI-POS,OAL-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The main novelties of the paper are: (1) the use of Tumblr data,[[DAT-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] (2) the proposed CNN architecture, combining images and text (using word embedding.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nI missed a \"related work section\", where authors clearly mention previous works on similar datasets.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Some related works are mentioned in the paper, but those are spread in different sections.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] It's hard to get a clear overview of the previous research: datasets, methods and contextualization of the proposed approach in relation with previous work.[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I think authors should cite Sentibanks.[[CNT], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Also, at some point authors should compare their proposal with previous work.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] \n\nMore comments:\n\n- Some figures could be more complete: to see more examples in Fig 1, 2, 3 would help to understand better the dataset and the challenges.[[DAT-NEG,TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n- In table 4, for example, it would be nice to see the performance on the different emotion categories.[[TNF-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \n- It would be interesting to see qualitative visual results on recognitions.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \n\nI like this work,[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]]  but I think authors should improve the aspects I mention for its publication.\n"[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]
