"The papers proposes a recurrent neural network-based model to learn the temporal evolution of a probability density function.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A Monte Carlo method is suggested for approximating the high dimensional integration required for multi-step-ahead prediction.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe approach is tested on two artificially generated datasets and on two real-world datasets, and compared with standard approaches such as the autoregressive model, the Kalman filter, and a regression LSTM.\[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]n\nThe paper is quite dense and quite difficult to follow, also due to the complex notation used by the authors.\[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]n\nThe comparison with other methods is very week, the authors compare their approach with two very simple alternatives, namely a first-order autoregressive mode and the Kalman filter.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  More sophisticated should have been employed."[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
