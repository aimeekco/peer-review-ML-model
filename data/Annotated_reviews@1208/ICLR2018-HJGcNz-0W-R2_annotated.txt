"Paper summary:\nAuthors extend [1] to form an auto-encoder CNN network for face mesh representation.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Face mesh graph is represented by Fourier basis of graph Laplacian and therefore convolution operator is defined in Fourier space.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  Chebyshev polynomial is used for faster computations.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  Max pooling on graph is done by using Graclus multilevel clustering algorithm.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  Binary tree generated in pooling layers are kept for unpooling layers in decoder network.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  Authors captured a new facial dataset for their evaluation and reported better results than PCA.[[DAT-POS,RES-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nPositive points:\nAuthors tackle irregular data feature extraction and learning using CNNs which is a hot topic in deep learning.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nNegative points:\nAlthough proposed idea is interesting,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  paper has a number of critical problems. [[OAL-NEG], [CNT], [CRT], [MAJ]] Firstly, experiments are the main weakness of the paper.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Set of experiments does not prove claims of the paper.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n- It is not clear how authors uses PCA to reconstruct faces in the test set.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]] \n- Authors do not compare to any state of the art on 3D face representation and reconstruction (e.g. [2]) using public datasets (e.g. BU-3DFE).[[DAT-NEU,RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n- How network behaves by introducing noise on vertices?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n- What is the effect of network hyper-parameters?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] \n\nSecondly, paper has a lack of novelty.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  It is a simple extension of [1] without considering and solving problems in [1].[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Also, it is not mentioned what is the loss function to train the network.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I suppose it is L2 norm loss, but it must be clear in the paper.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n[1] M.
