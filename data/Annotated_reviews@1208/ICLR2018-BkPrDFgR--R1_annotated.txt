"The paper studies methods for verifying neural nets through their piecewise\nlinear structure.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors survey different methods from the literature,\npropose a novel one, and evaluate them on a set of benchmarks.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nA major drawback of the evaluation of the different approaches is that\neverything was used with its default parameters.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]] It is very unlikely that these\ndefaults are optimal across the different benchmarks.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MAJ]] To get a better impression\nof what approaches perform well, their parameters should be tuned to the\nparticular benchmark.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] This may significantly change the conclusions drawn from\nthe experiments.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nFigures 4-7 are hard to interpret and do not convey a clear message.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] There is no\nclear trend in many of them and a lot of noise. [[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]It may be better to relate the\nstructure of the network to other measures of the hardness of a problem, e.g.\nthe phase transition.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Again parameter tuning would potentially change all of\nthese figures significantly, as would e.g. a change in hardware.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Given the kind\nof general trend the authors seem to want to show here, I feel that a more\ntheoretic measure of problem hardness would be more appropriate here.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nThe authors say of the proposed TwinStream dataset that it \"may not be\nrepresentative of real use-cases\". It seems odd to propose something that is\nentirely artificial.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe description of the empirical setup could be more detailed.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Are the\nproperties that are being verified different properties, or the same property on\ndifferent networks?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nThe tables look ugly.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It seems that the header \"data set\" should be \"approach\"\nor something similar.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nIn summary, I feel that while there are some issues with the paper, it presents\ninteresting results and can be accepted."[[RES-POS,OAL-NEU], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]
