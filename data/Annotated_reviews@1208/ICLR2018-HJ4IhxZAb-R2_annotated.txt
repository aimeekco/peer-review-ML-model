"This reviewer has found the proposed approach quite compelling, but the empirical validation requires significant improvements:[[PDI-POS,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]\n1) you should include in your comparison Query-by- Bagging & Boosting, which are two of the best out-of-the-box active learning strategies\[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]n2) in your empirical validation you have (arbitrarily) split the 14 datasets in 7 training and testing ones but many questions are still unanswered:[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n -  would any 7-7 split work just as well (ie, cross-validate over the 14 domains)[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]\n - do you what happens if you train on 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, or 13 domains?[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] are the results significantly different?[[RWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]] \n\nOTHER COMMENTS:\n- p3: both images in Figure 1 are labeled Figure 1.a\n- p3: typo \"theis\" --> \"this\" \n\nAbe & Mamitsuksa (ICML-1998)[[TNF-NEU,BIB-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]].
