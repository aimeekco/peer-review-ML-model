"This work presents a CNN training setup that uses half precision implementation that can get 2X speedup for training.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [GEN]] The work is clearly presented and the evaluations seem convincing.[[RWK-POS,ANA-POS], [PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The presented implementations are competitive in terms of accuracy, when compared to the FP32 representation.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]  I'm not an expert in this area but the contribution seems relevant to me, and enough for being published."[[EXT-NEU], [null], [FBK], [GEN]]
