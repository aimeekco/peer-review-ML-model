"The main result specifies a (trigger) strategy (CCC) and corresponding algorithm that leads to an efficient outcome in social dilemmas, the theoretical basis of which is provided by theorem 1.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This underscores an algorithm that uses a prosocial adjustment of the agents rewards to encourage efficient behaviour.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The paper makes a useful contribution in demonstrating that convergence to efficient outcomes in social dilemmas without the need for agents to observe each other's actions.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The paper is also clearly written and the theoretical result is accompanied by some supporting experiments.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The numerical experiments show that using CCC strategy leads to an increase in the proportion of efficient equilibrium outcomes.[[RES-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, in order to solidify the experimental validation, the authors could consider a broader range of experimental evaluations. [[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]There are also a number of items that could be added that I believe would strengthen the contribution and novelty, in particular:\n\nSome highly relevant references on (prosocial) reward shaping in social dilemmas are missing, such as Babes, Munoz de cote and Littman, 2008 and for the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma; Vassiliades and Christodoulou, 2010 which all provide important background material on the subject.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]] In addition, it would be useful to see how the method put forward in the paper compares with other (reward-shaping) techniques within MARL (especially in the perfect information case in the pong players' dilemma (PPD) experiment) such as those already mentioned.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] The authors could, therefore, provide more detail in relating the contribution to these papers and other relevant past work and existing algorithms.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] \n\nThe paper also omits any formal discussion on the equilibrium concepts being used in the Markov game setting (e.g. Markov Perfect Equilibrium or Markov-Nash equilibrium) which leaves a notable gap in the theoretical analysis.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]  \n\nThere are also some questions that to me, remain unaddressed namely:\n\ni.] the model of the experiments, particularly a description of the structure of the pong players' dilemma in terms of the elements of the partially observed Markov game described in definition 1.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] In particular, what are the state space and transitions?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nii. the equilibrium concepts being considered i.e. does the paper consider Markov perfect equilibria.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Some analysis on the conditions that under which the continuation equilibria e.g. cooperation in the social dilemma is expected to arise would also be beneficial.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\niii. Although the formal discussion is concerned with Markov games (i.e. repeated games with stochastic transitions with multiple states) the experiments (particularly the PPD) appear to apply to repeated games (this could very much be cleared up with a formal description of the games in the experimental sections and the equilibrium concept being used).[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\niv. In part 1 of the proof of the main theorem, it seems unclear why the sign of the main inequality has changed after application of Cauchy convergence in probability (equation at the top of the page).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] As this is an important component of the proof of the main result, the paper would benefit from an explanation of this step?\n"[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
