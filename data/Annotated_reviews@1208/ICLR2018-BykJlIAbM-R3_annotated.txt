"This work tries to generalize the framework of reward augmented maximum likelihood criterion by introducing the notion of cluster, which represents a set of similar data point, e.g., sentence, according to a metric.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] By employing the cluster, this work propose a joint source/target modeling by varying how sampling is performed, e.g., draw independently or conditionally, and how the cluster are constructed, e.g., model-wise or non-model.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Experiments on German/English and Chinese/English show gains over other reinforcement learning methods.[[EXP-POS], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nIf my understanding is correct, the motivation is investigate alternative combination of how a cluster is constructed, e.g., sampling and model-based scoring.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [MAJ]] However one of the problems of this paper is clarity.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\n- The notion of cluster is still unclear and it took me long to understand it probably because it might be easily confused with other terminology, e.g., clustering.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Also, cluster-to-cluster might not fit well.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [GEN]] \n\n- It is hard to map System-{ABCD} to the underlying proposed methods described in Table 2.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Also, I feel algorithm 1 is spurious given that it merely switch by systems.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MAJ]] Probably better to introduce branch for key methods, parallel sampling/ translation broadcasting and inadaptive or adaptive model.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n"
