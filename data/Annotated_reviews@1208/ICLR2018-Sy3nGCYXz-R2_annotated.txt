"This paper analyzed the dimensionality of feature maps and fully connected layers of pre-trained CNN on images within a same category.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The local dimensionality of this paper is the SVD dimensionality on the augmented images of the same class images which classified by the neural network as high probability.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] However, the motivation of the analysis of this paper is unclear.[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I could not understand how such analysis contributes advance of representation learning.[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nFurther, the analysis of this paper is not convincing.[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  \n-      I cannot believe the sum of SVD dimensionality of each feature maps becomes equals to the dimensionality to concatenated feature maps.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] As shown in in Fig.8, the estimated dimensions and original dimensions are very different.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] Although by looking some features maps, this rule might be hold as shown in Fig.5.[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] However, the analysis is done on small examples without any theoretical analysis.[[DAT-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n-\tThe authors experimented one trained CNN and tested on images on only three categories (Persian Cat, Container Ship, and Volcao).[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]] It is not clear if the same rules holds to other CNNs, and images of other categories. \n"[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
