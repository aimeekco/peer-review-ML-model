"The paper presents an extension of the Xception network of (Chollet et al. 2016) 2D grids to generic graphs.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The Xception network decouples the spatial correlations from depth channels correlations by having separate weights for each depth channel.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The weights within a depth channel is shared thus maintaining the stationary requirement.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed filter relaxes this requirement by forming the weights as the output of a two-layer perception.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper includes a detailed comparison of the existing formulations from the traditional label propagation scheme to more recent more graph convolutions (Kipf & Welling, 2016 ) and geometric convolutions  (Monti et al. 2016).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nThe paper provides quantitative evaluations under three different settings i) image classification, ii) Time series forcasting iii) Document classification.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] The proposed method out-performs all other graph convolutions on all the tasks (except image classification) though having comparable or less number of parameters.[[MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] For image classification, the performance of proposed method is below its predecessor Xception network.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nPros:\ni) Detailed review of the existing work and comparison with the proposed work.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nii) The three experiments performed showed variety in terms of underlying graph structure hence provides a thorough evaluation of different methods under different settings.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\niii) Superior performance with fewer number of parameters compared to other methods.[[MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \nCons:\ni) The architecture of the 2 layer MLP used to learn weights for a particular depth channel is not provided.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nii) The performance difference between Xception and proposed method for image classification experiments using CIFAR is incoherent with the intuitions provided Sec 3.1 as the proposed method have more parameters and is a generalized version of DSC."[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
