"\nSummary:\n\nAuthors propose a method which uses a Q-learning-based high-level policy which is combined with a contextual mask derived from safety-contraints and low-level controllers which disable certain actions from being selectable at certain states.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe high-level policy is learnt via fairly standard Q-learning (epsilon-greedy exploration policy and a NN function approximator.)[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nExperiments in a simple car simulator on a task which requires the car to take a certain exit while navigating through traffic are presented with two baselines: 1. a greedy policy which navigates to the right-most lane asap and then follows traffic till the exit is reached.[[PDI-NEU,RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] 2. human subjects driving cars in the simulator.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n\nComments:\n\n- Why use a model-free technique like Q-learning especially when one knows the model of the car in autonomous driving setting and can simply run model-predictive control (MPC) (convolve forward the model to get candidate trajectories of certain reasonable horizon, evaluate and pick the best trajectory, execute selected trajectory for a few time-steps and then rinse-and-repeat.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] This is a very well-accepted method actually used in real-world autonomous cars.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] See the Urmson et al. 2008 paper in the bibliography.) At the very least this technique should be a baseline.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] This method is not learning-based, doesn't need training data in a simulator, generalizes to **any** exit and lane configuration and variants of this basic technique continue to be used on real-world autonomous cars.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n- What kind of safety constraints cannot be expressed by masking actions?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]] It seems that most safety constraints can be expressed via masking.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] But certain kinds of safety constraints like 'do not drive in the blindspot of other vehicles' sometimes require the ego car to speed up for a bit beyond the speed limit to pass the blindspot area and then slow down.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This is an example of a constraint which cannot be expressed by masking actions and in fact requires breaking the top speed limit for a bit in order to be safer in the longer term.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\n- This work also assumes that other cars in the vicinity can be simply observed without any perception uncertainty or even through occlusions.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Figure 1c is pretty unrealistic to obtain for a real vehicle, especially for the four cars near the top where the topmost vehicles would be occluded at least partially from the vantage point of the ego-car.
