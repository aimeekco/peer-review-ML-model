"The authors tackle the problem of estimating risk in a survival analysis setting with competing risks.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] They propose directly optimizing the time-dependent discrimination index using a siamese survival network.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Experiments on several real-world dataset reveal modest gains in comparison with the state of the art.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [NOV-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]\n\n- The authors should clearly highlight what is their main technical contribution.[[RWK-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] For example, Eqs. 1-6 appear to be background material since the time-dependent discrimination index is taken from the literature, as the authors point out earlier[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]. However, this is unclear from the writing. [[RWK-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n- One of the main motivations of the authors is to propose a model that is specially design to avoid the nonidentifiability issue in an scenario with competing risks.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] It is unclear why the authors solution is able to solve such an issue, specially given the modest reported gains in comparison with several competitive baselines.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [CLA-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,QSN], [MIN]] In other words, the authors oversell their own work, specially in comparison with the state of the art.[[EXT-NEG], [null], [CRT,FBK], [MIN]]\n\n- The authors use off-the-shelf siamese networks for their settting and thus it is questionable there is any novelty there.[[RWK-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]] The application/setting may be novel,[[RWK-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] but not the architecture of choice.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n- From Eq. 4 to Eq. 5, the authors argue that the denominator does not depend on the model parameters and can be ignored.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] However, afterwards the objective does combine time-dependent discrimination indices of several competing risks, with different denominator values.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] This could be problematic if the risks are unbalanced.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n- The competitive gain of the authors method in comparison with other competing methods is minor.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\n- The authors introduce F(t, D | x) as cumulative incidence function (CDF) at the beginning of section 2, however, afterwards they use R^m(t, x), which they define as risk of the subject experiencing event m before t.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] Is the latter a proxy for the former? How are they related?"[[RWK-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]
