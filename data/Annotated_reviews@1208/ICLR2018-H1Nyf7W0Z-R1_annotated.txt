"The paper proposes another training objective for training neural sequence-to-sequence models.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The objective is based on alpha-divergence between the true input-output distribution q and the model distribution p.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The new objective generalizes  Reward-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) and entropy-regularized Reinforcement Learning (RL), to which it presumably degenerates when alpha goes to 1 or to 0 respectively.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper has significant writing issues.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] In Paragraph \u201cMaximum Likelihood\u201d, page 2, the formalization of the studied problem is unclear.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Do X and Y denote the complete input/output spaces, or do they stand for the training set examples only?[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  In the former case, the statement \u201cx is uniformly sampled from X\u201d does not make sense because X is practically infinite.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] Same applies to the dirac distribution q(y|x), the true conditional distribution of outputs given inputs is multimodal even for machine translation.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] If X and Y were meant to refer to the training set, it would be worth mentioning the existence of the test set.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] Furthermore, in the same Section 2 the paper fails to mention that reinforcement learning training also does not completely correspond to the evaluation approach, at which stage greedy search or beam search is used.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe proposed method is evaluated on just one dataset.[[DAT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Crucially, there is no comparison to a trivial linear combination of ML and RL, which in one way or another was used in almost all prior work, including GNMT, Bahdanau et al, Ranzato et al.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The paper does not argue why alpha divergence is better that the aforementioned combination method and also does not include it in the comparison.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nTo sum up, I can not recommend the paper to acceptance,[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]] because (a) an important baseline is missing[[RWK-NEG], [null], [DFT], [MAJ]] (b) there are serious writing issues.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n"
