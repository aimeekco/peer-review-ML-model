"This paper is concerned with both security and machine learning.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \nAssuming that data is encoded, transmited, and decoded using a VAE,\nthe paper proposes a man-in-middle attack that alters the VAE encoding of the input data so that the decoded output will be misclassified.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe objectives are to: 1) fool the autoencoder; the classification output of the autoencoder is different from the actual class of the input;[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] 2) make minimal change in the middle so that the attack is not detectable.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThis paper is concerned with both security and machine learning, but there is no clear contributions to either field.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] From the machine learning perspective, the proposed \"attacking\" method is standard without any technical novelty.[[MET-NEU], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] From the security perspective, the scenarios are too simplistic.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The encoding-decoding mechanism being attacked is too simple without any security enhancement.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] This is an unrealistic scenario.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] For applications with security concerns, there should have been methods to guard against man-in-the-middle attack, and the paper should have at least considered some of them.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]] Without considering the state-of-the-art security defending mechanism, it is difficult to judge the contribution of the paper to the security community.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]] \n\nI am not a security expert, but I doubt that the proposed method are formulated based on well founded security concepts and ideas.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] For example, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for an attacking method to be undetectable?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Are the criteria about the magnitude of epsilon given on Section 3.3. necessary and sufficient?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is there any reference for them?[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Why do we require the correspondence between the classification confidence of tranformed and original data?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Would it be enough to match the DISTRIBUTION of the confidence?
