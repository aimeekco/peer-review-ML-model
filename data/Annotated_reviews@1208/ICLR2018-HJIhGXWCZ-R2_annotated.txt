"The paper proposes a model for prediction under uncertainty where the separate out deterministic component prediction and uncertain component prediction.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThey propose to have a predictor for deterministic information generation using a standard transformer trained via MSE.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nFor the non-deterministic information, they have a residual predictor that uses a low-dimensional latent space. [[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]This low-dim latent space is first predicted from the residual of the (deterministic prediction - groundtruth), and then the low-dim encoding goes into a network that predicts a corrected image.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\nThe subtleness of this work over most other video prediction work is that it isn't conditioned on a labeled latent space (like text to video prediction, for example).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Hence inferring a structured latent space is a challenge.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\nThe training procedure follows an alternative minimization in EM style.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe biggest weakness of the paper (and the reason for my final decision) is that the paper completely goes easy on baseline models.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It's only baseline is a GAN model that isn't even very convincing (GANs are finicky to train, so is this a badly tuned GAN model?[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] or did you spend a lot of time tuning it?).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nBecause of the plethora of VAE models used in video prediction [1] (albeit, used with pre-structured latent spaces), there has to be atleast one VAE baseline.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Just because such a baseline wasn't previously proposed in literature (in the narrow scope of this problem) doesn't mean it's not an obvious baseline to try.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] In fact, a VAE would be nicely suited when proposing to work with low-dimensional latent spaces.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe main signal I lack from reading the paper is whether the proposed model actually does better than a reasonable baseline.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\nIf the baselines are stronger and this point is more convincing, I am happy to raise my rating of the paper.\n\n[1] [[RWK-NEU,OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU], [SUG,FBK], [MAJ]]http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Marwah_Attentive_Semantic_Video_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf"[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]
