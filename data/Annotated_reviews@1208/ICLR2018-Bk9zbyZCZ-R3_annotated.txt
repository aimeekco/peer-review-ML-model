"# Summary\nThis paper presents a new external-memory-based neural network (Neural Map) for handling partial observability in reinforcement learning.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed memory architecture is spatially-structured so that the agent can read/write from/to specific positions in the memory.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The results on several memory-related tasks in 2D and 3D environments show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines such as LSTM and MQN/FRMQN.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\n[Pros]\n- The overall direction toward more flexible/scalable memory is an important research direction in RL.[[PDI-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- The proposed memory architecture is new. [[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- The paper is well-written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n[Cons]\n- The proposed memory architecture is new but a bit limited to 2D/3D navigation tasks.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- Lack of analysis of the learned memory behavior.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\n# Novelty and Significance\nThe proposed idea is novel in general.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS,IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Though [Gupta et al.] proposed an ego-centric neural memory in the RL context, the proposed memory architecture is still new in that read/write operations are flexible enough for the agent to write any information to the memory, whereas [Gupta et al.] designed the memory specifically for predicting free space.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS], [NOV-POS,CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] On the other hand, the proposed method is also specific to navigation tasks in 2D or 3D environment, which is hard to apply to more general memory-related tasks in non-spatial environments.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] But, it is still interesting to see that the ego-centric neural memory works well on challenging tasks in a 3D environment.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]]\n\n# Quality\nThe experiment does not show any analysis of the learned memory read/write behavior especially for ego-centric neural map and the 3D environment.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] It is hard to understand how the agent utilizes the external memory without such an analysis.[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n# Clarity\nThe paper is overall clear and easy-to-follow except for the following.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] In the introduction section, the paper claims that \"the expert must set M to a value that is larger than the time horizon of the currently considered task\" when mentioning the limitation of the previous work.[[INT-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] In some sense, however, Neural Map also requires an expert to specify the proper size of the memory based on prior knowledge about the task.
