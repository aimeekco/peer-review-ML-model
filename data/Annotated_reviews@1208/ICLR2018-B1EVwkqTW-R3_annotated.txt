"Summary: \nThe paper proposes to pre-train a deep neural network to learn a similarity function and use the features obtained by this pre-trained network as input to an SVM model.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The SVM is trained for the final classification task at hand using the last layer features of the deep network.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The motivation behind all this is to learn the input features to the SVM as opposed to hand-crafting them, and use the generalization ability of the SVM to do well on tasks which have only a handful of training examples.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors apply their technique to two datasets, namely, the Omniglot dataset and the TIMIT dataset and show that their model does a reasonable job in these two tasks.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nWhile the paper is reasonably clearly written and easy to read[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I have a number of objections to it.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nFirst, I did not see any novel idea presented in this paper.[[PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Lots of people have tried pre-training a neural network on auxiliary task(s) and using the features from it as input to the final SVM classifier.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] People have also specifically tried to train a siamese network and use its features as input to the SVM.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] These works go way back to the years 2005 - 2007, when deep learning was not called deep learning. [[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]Unless I have missed something completely, I did not see any novel idea proposed in this paper.[[PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nSecond, the experiments are quite underwhelming and does not fully support the superiority claims of the proposed approach.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] For example, the authors compare their model against rather weak baselines.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] While the approach (as has been shown in the past) is very reasonable,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I would have liked the experiments to be more thorough, with comparison to the state of the art models for the two datasets. \n",[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
