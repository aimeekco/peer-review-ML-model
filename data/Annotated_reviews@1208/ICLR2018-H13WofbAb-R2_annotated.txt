"This paper considers distributed synchronous SGD, and proposes to use \"partial pulling\" to alleviate the problem with slow servers.[[INT-NEU,PDI-POS,MET-NEU], [SUB-POS], [SMY,DFT], [GEN]]\n\nThe motivation is that the server may be a straggler.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] The authors suggested one possibility, namely that the server and some workers are located on the same machine and the workers take most of the computational resource[[INT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,APC], [GEN]]. However, if this is the case, a simple solution would be to move the server to a different node.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] A more convincing argument for a slow server should be provided[[INT-POS,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]].\n\nThough the authors claimed that they used 3 techniques to accelerate synchronous SGD, only partial pulling is proposed by them (the other 2 are borrowed straightforwardly from existing papers). [[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU,BIB-NEU], [SUB-NEU,IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY,SUG,DIS], [GEN]]The mechanism of partial pulling is very simple (just let SGD proceed after pulling a partial parameter block instead of the whole block).[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] As mentioned by the authors in section 1, any relaxation in synchrony brings more noise and higher variance to the updates, and also may cause slow convergence or convergence to a poor solution.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEG,RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] However, the authors provided no theoretical study on any of these aspects.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nExperimental results are not convincing.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Only one relatively small dataset (cifar10) is used Moreover, the slow server problem is only simulated by artificially adding delays to the server."[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
