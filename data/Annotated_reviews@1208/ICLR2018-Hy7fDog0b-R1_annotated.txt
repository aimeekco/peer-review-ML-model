"Quick summary:\nThis paper shows how to train a GAN in the case where the dataset is corrupted by some measurement noise process.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They propose to introduce the noise process into the generation pipeline such that the GAN generates a clean image, corrupts its own output and feeds that into the discriminator.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The discriminator then needs to decide whether this is a real corrupted measurement or a generated one.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The method is demonstrated to the generate better results than the baseline on a variety of datasets and noise processes.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nQuality:\nI found this to be a nice paper - it has an important setting to begin with and the proposed method is clean and elegant albeit a bit simple.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,PNF-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nOriginality:\nI'm pretty sure this is the first paper to tackle this problem directly in general.[[OAL-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSignificance:\nThis is an important research direction as it is not uncommon to get noisy measurements in the real world under different circumstances.[[OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nPros:\n* Important problem[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n* elegant and simple solution[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n* nice results and decent experiments (but see below)[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n* The assumption that the measurement process *and* parameters are known is quite a strong one.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] Though it is quite common in the literature to assume this, it would have been interesting to see if there's a way to handle the case where it is unknown (either the process, parameters or both).[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]]\n* The baseline experiments are a bit limited - it's clear that such baselines would never produce samples which are any better than the \"fixed\" version which is fed into them.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] I can't however, think of other baselines other than \"ignore\" so I guess that is acceptable.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n* I wish the authors would show that they get a *useful* model eventually - for example, can this be used to denoise other images from the dataset?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nSummary:\nThis is a nice paper which deals with an important problem, has some nice results and while not groundbreaking, certainly merits a publication."[[PDI-POS,RES-NEU,OAL-POS], [REC-POS,EMP-POS], [APC,FBK], [MAJ]]
