"This contribution deal with nuisance factors afflicting biological cell images with a domain adaptation approach: the embedding vectors generated from cell images show spurious correlation.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [SMY,APC], [MAJ]] The authors define a Wasserstein Distance Network to find  a suitable affine transformation that reduces the nuisance factor.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The evaluation on a real dataset yields correct results, this approach is quite general and could be applied to different problems.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe contribution of this approach could be better highlighted.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] The early stopping criteria tend to favor suboptimal solution, indeed relying on the Cramer distance is possible improvement.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nAs a side note, the k-NN MOA is central to for the evaluation of the proposed approach.[[MET-POS], [EMP-NEU], [APC], [MIN]] A possible improvement is to try other means for the embedding instead of the Euclidean one.\n\n"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
