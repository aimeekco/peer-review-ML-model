"This paper deals with early stopping but the contributions are limited.[[PDI-NEU,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This work would fit better a workshop as a preliminary result, furthermore it is too short.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Following a short review section per section.[[EXT-NEU], [CNT], [CNT], [GEN]]\n\nIntro: The name SFC is misleading as the method consists in stopping early the training with an optimized learning schedule scheme.[[INT-NEG,MET-NEG,OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Furthermore, the work is not compared to the appropriate baselines.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nProposal: The first motivation is not clear.[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The training time of the feature extractor has never been a problem for transfer learning tasks for example: once it is trained, you can reuse the architecture in a wide range of tasks.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Besides, the training time of a CNN on CIFAR10 or even ImageNet is now quite small(for reasonable architectures), which allows fast benchmarking.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\nThe second motivation, w.r.t. IB seems interesting[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but this should be empirically motivated(e.g. figures) in the subsection 2.1, and this is not done.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThe section 3 is quite long and could be compressed to improve the relevance of this experimental section.[[EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] All the accuracies(unsup dict, unsup, etc) on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 are reported from the paper (Oyallon & Mallat, 2015), ignoring 2-3 years of research that leads to new numerical results.[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Furthermore, this supervised technique is only compared to unsupervised or predefined methods, which is is not fair and the training time of the Scattering Transform is not reported, for example.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nFinally, extracting features is mainly useful on ImageNet (for realistic images) and this is not reported here.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nI believe re-thinking new learning rate schedules is interesting,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MIN]] however I recommend the rejection of this paper."[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]]
