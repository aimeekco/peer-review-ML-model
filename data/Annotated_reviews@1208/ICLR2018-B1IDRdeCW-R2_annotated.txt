"This paper presents three observations to understand binary network in Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016).[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] My main concerns are on the usage of the given observations.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\n1. Can the observations be used to explain more recent works?[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nIndeed, Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016) is a good and pioneered work on the binary network.[[EXT-POS], [null], [APC], [GEN]] However, as the authors mentioned, there are more recent works which give better performance than this one.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, we can use +1, 0, -1 to approximate the weights.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] Besides, [a] has also shown a carefully designed post-processing binary network can already give very good performance.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] So, how can the given observations be used to explain more recent works?[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n2. How can the given observations be used to improve Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016)?[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nThe authors call their findings theory.[[OAL-NEU], [CNT], [DIS], [GEN]] From this perspective, I wish to see more mathematical analysis rather than just doing experiments and showing some interesting observations.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,DIS], [MAJ]] Besides, giving interesting observations is not good enough.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I wish to see how they can be used to improve binary networks.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nReference\n[a].
