"The paper entitled 'Siamese Survival Analysis' reports an application of a deep learning to three cases of competing risk survival analysis.[[ABS-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The author follow the reasoning that '... these ideas were not explored in the context of survival analysis', thereby disregarding the significant published literature based on the Concordance Index (CI). [[PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nBesides this deficit, the paper does not present a proper statistical setup (e.g. 'Is censoring assumed to be at random? ...) , and numerical results are only referring to some standard implementations, thereby again neglecting the state-of-the-art solution. [[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG,OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]That being said, this particular use of deep learning in this context might be novel.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]"
