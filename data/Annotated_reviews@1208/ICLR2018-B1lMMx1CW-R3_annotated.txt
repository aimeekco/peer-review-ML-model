"This paper presents a practical methodology to use neural network for recommending products to users based on their past purchase history.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The model contains three components: a predictor model which is essentially a RNN-style model to capture near-term user interests, a time-decay function which serves as a way to decay the input based on when the purchase happened, and an auto-encoder component which makes sure the user's past purchase history get fully utilized, with the consideration of time decay.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] And the paper showed the combination of the three performs the best in terms of precision@K and PCC@K, and also with good scalability.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It also showed good online A/B test performance, which indicates that this approach has been tested in real world.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nTwo small concerns:\n1. In Section 3.3. I am not fully sure why the proposed predictor model is able to win over LSTM.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] As LSTM tends to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem which most likely would exist in the predictor model.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Some insights might be useful there.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n2. The title of this paper is weird.[[INT-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Suggest to rephrase \"unreasonable\" to something more positive. [[INT-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
