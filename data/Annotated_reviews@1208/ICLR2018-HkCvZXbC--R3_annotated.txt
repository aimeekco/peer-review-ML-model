"\n- Paper summary\n\nThe paper proposes a label-conditional GAN generator architecture and a GAN training objective for the image modeling task.[[ABS-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The proposed GAN generator consists of two components where one focuses on generating foreground while the other focuses on generating background.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] The GAN training objective function utilizing 3 conditional classifier.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] It is shown that through combining the generator architecture and the GAN training objective function, one can learn a foreground--background decomposed generative model in an unsupervised manner[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY,DIS], [GEN]]. The paper shows results on the MNIST, SVHN, and Celebrity Faces datasets.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n- Poor experimental validation\n\nWhile it is interesting to know that a foreground--background decomposed generative model can be learned in an unsupervised manner, [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEU], [SMY,DFT], [MIN]]it is clear how this capability can help practical applications, especially no such examples are shown in the paper.[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The paper also fails to provide any quantitative evaluation of the proposed method.[[PDI-NEG,ANA-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] For example, the paper will be more interesting if inception scores were shown for various challenging datasets.[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEG], [SUG,DFT], [MIN]]  In additional, there is no ablation study analyzing impacts of each design choices[[RWK-NEG,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]. As a result, the paper carries very little scientific value."[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [IMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]
