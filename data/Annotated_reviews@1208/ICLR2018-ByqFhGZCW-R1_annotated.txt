"The game-theoretic approach to attacks with / defense against adversarial examples is an important direction of the security of deep learning and I appreciate the authors to initiate this kind of study.[[INT-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nLemma 1 summarizes properties of the solutions that are expected to have after reaching equilibria.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Important properties of saddle points in the min-max/max-min analysis assume that the function is convex/concave w.r.t. to the target variable.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  In case of deep learning, the convexity is not guaranteed and the resulting solutions do not have necessarily follow Lemma 1.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DFT], [MAJ]]\u3000Nonetheless, this type of analysis can be useful under appropriate solutions if non-trivial claims are derived; however, Lemma 1 simply explains basic properties of the min-max solutions and max-min solutions works and does not contain non-tibial claims.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nAs long as the analysis is experimental, the state of the art should be considered.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] As long as the reviewer knows, the CW attack gives the most powerful attack and this should be considered for comparison. The results with MNIST and CIFAR-10 are different.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] In some cases, MNIST is too easy to consider the complex structure of deep architectures.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] I prefer to have discussions on experimental results with both datasets.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MAJ]]\n\nThe main takeaway from the entire paper is not clear very much.[[OAL-NEU], [IMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It contains a game-theoretic framework of adversarial examples/training, novel attack method, and many experimental results.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nMinor:\nDefinition of g in the beginning of Sec 3.1 seems to be a typo.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] What is u? This is revealed in the latter sections but should be specified here.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nIn Section 3.1, \n>This is in stark contrast with the near-perfect misclassification of the undefended classifier in Table 1.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\nThe results shown in the table seems to indicate the \u201cperfect\u201d misclassification.[[TNF-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nSentence after eq. 15 seems to contain a grammatical error.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nThe paragraph after eq. 17 is duplicated with a paragraph introduced before.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n"
