"The paper presents a Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution network that aims\nat generalizing Depthwise convolutions, that exhibit a nice performance in image\nrelated tasks, to the graph domain.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In particular it targets\nGraph Convolutional Networks.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nIn the abstract the authors mention that the Depthwise Separable Graph Convolution\nthat they propose is the key to understand the connections between geometric\nconvolution methods and traditional 2D ones.[[ABS-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] I am afraid I have to disagree as\nthe proposed approach is not giving any better understanding of what needs to be\ndone and why.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] It is an efficient way to mimic what has worked so far for the planar\ndomain but I would not consider it as fundamental in \"closing the gap\".[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nI feel that the text is often redundant and that it could be simplified a lot.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]] \nFor example the authors state in various parts that DSC does not work on\nnon-Euclidean data.[[DAT-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  Section 2 should be clearer and used to better explain\nrelated approaches to motivate the proposed one.[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \nIn fact, the entire motivation, at least for me, never went beyond the simple fact\nthat this happens to be a good way to improve performance.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  The intuition given\nis not sufficient to substantiate some of the claims on generality and understanding\nof graph based DL.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] \n\nIn 3.1, at point (2), the authors mention that DSC filters are learned from the\ndata whereas GC uses a constant matrix.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  This is not correct, as also reported in\nequation 2. [[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The matrix U is learned from the data as well.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nEquation (4) shows that the proposed approach would weight Q different GC\nlayers.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]  In practical terms this is a linear combination of these graph\nconvolutional layers.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \nWhat is not clear is the \\Delta_{ij} definition.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]  It is first introduced in 2.3\nand described as the relative position of pixel i and pixel j on the image, but\nthen used in the context of a graph in (4).[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] What is the coordinate system used\nby the authors in this case?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] This is a very important point that should be made\nclearer.[[MET-NEU], [CNT], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nWhy is the Related Work section at the end?[[RWK-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] I would put it at the front.[[RWK-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nThe experiments compare with the recent relevant literature.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] I think that having\nless number of parameters is a good thing in this setting as the data is scarce,\nhowever I would like to see a more in-depth comparison with respect to the number\nof features produced by the model itself.[[DAT-POS,ANA-NEU], [SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] For example GCN has a representation\nspace (latent) much smaller than DSCG.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\nNo statistics over multiple runs are reported, and given the high variance of\nresults on these datasets I would like them to be reported.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nI think the separability of the filters in this case brings the right level of\nsimplification to the learning task, however as it also holds for the planar case\nit is not clear whether this is necessarily the best way forward.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\nWhat are the underlying mathematical insights that lead towards selecting\nseparable convolutions?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nOverall I found the paper interesting but not ground-breaking.[[OAL-NEU], [CNT], [DIS], [MAJ]] A nice application\nof the separable principle to GCN.[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]] Results are also interesting[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] but should be\nfurther verified by multiple runs.\n"[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
