"This paper concerns open-world classification.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]  The open-world related tasks have been defined in many previous works.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] This paper had made a good survey.[[OAL-POS], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] \nThe only special point of the open-word classification task defined in this paper is to employ the constraints from the similarity/difference expected for examples from the same class or from different classes.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  Unfortunately, this paper is lack of novelty.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nFirstly, the problem context and setting is kinda synthesized.[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] I cannot quite imagine in what kind of applications we can get \u201ca set of pairs of intra-class (same class) examples, and the negative training data consists of a set of pairs of inter-class\u201d.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nSecondly, this model is just a direct combination of the recent powerful algorithms such as DOC and other simple traditional models.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I do not really see enough novelty here.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nThirdly, the experiments are only on the MNIST and EMNIST; still not quite sure any real-world problems/datasets can be used to validate this approach.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nI also cannot see the promising performance.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]The clustering results of rejected\nexamples are still far from the ground truth, and comparing the result with\na total unsupervised K-means is a kind of unreasonable.\n"[[RES-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
