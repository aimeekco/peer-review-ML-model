"The main idea is to use the accuracy of a classifier trained on synthetic training examples produced by a generative model to define an evaluation metric for the generative model. [[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]Specifically, compare the accuracy of a classifier trained on a noise-perturbed version of the real dataset to that of a classifier trained on a mix of real data and synthetic data generated by the model being evaluated.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] Results are shown on MNIST and Fashion MNIST.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe paper should discuss the assumptions needed for classifier accuracy to be a good proxy for the quality of a generative model that generated the classifier's training data.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] It may be the case that even a \"bad\" generative model (according to some other metric) can still result in a classifier that produces reasonable test accuracy.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] Since a classifier can be a highly nonlinear function, it can potentially ignore many aspects of its input distribution such that even poor approximations (as measured by, say, KL) lead to similar test accuracy as good approximations.[[MET-NEG,ANA-POS], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nThe sensitivity of the evaluation metric defined in equation 2 to the choice of hyperparameters of the classifier and the metric itself (e.g., alpha) is not evaluated. [[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]Is it possible that a different choice of hyperparameters can change the model ranking[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]? Should the hyperparameters be tuned separately for each generative model being evaluated?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [GEN]]\n\nThe intuition behind comparing against a classifier trained on a noise-perturbed version of the data is not explained clearly. [[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEG,MET-NEU], [CLA-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]Why not compare a classifier trained on only (unperturbed) real data to a classifier trained on both real and synthetic data?[[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEU,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nEvaluation on two datasets is not sufficient to provide insight into whether the proposed metric is useful.[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,DAT-NEG,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DIS,CRT], [MIN]] Other datasets such as ImageNet, Cifar10/100, Celeb A, etc., should also be included.[[RWK-NEG,DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]"
