"In this work, the authors propose a procedure for tuning the parameters of an HMC algorithm (I guess, if I have understood correctly).\[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]n\nI think this paper has a good and strong point: this work points out the difficulties in choosing properly the parameters in a HMC method (such as the step and the number of iterations in the leapfrog integrator, for instance).[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] In the literature, specially in machine learning, there is ``fever\u2019\u2019 about HMC, in my opinion, partially unjustified.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nIf I have understood, your method is an adaptive HMC algorithm  where the parameters are updated online; or is the training  done in advance? Please, remark and clarify this point.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nHowever, I have other additional comments:\n\n- Eqs. (4) and (5) are quite complicated; I think a running toy example can help the interested reader.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n- I suggest to compare the proposed method to other efficient methods that do not use the gradient information (in some cases as multimodal posteriors, the use of the gradient information can be counter-productive for sampling purposes), such as Multiple Try Metropolis (MTM) schemes[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nL.
