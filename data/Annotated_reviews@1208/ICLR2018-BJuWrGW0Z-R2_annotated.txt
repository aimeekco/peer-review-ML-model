"Summary of paper: The paper proposes an RNN-based neural network architecture for embedding programs, focusing on the semantics of the program rather than the syntax.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The application is to predict errors made by students on programming tasks.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This is achieved by creating training data based on program traces obtained by instrumenting the program by adding print statements.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The neural network is trained using this program traces with an objective for classifying the student error pattern (e.g. list indexing, branching conditions, looping bounds).\n\n---\n\nQuality: The experiments compare the three proposed neural network architectures with two syntax-based architectures.[[EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It would be good to see a comparison with some techniques from Reed & De Freitas (2015) as this work also focuses on semantics-based embeddings.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\nClarity: The paper is clearly written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nOriginality: This work doesn't seem that original from an algorithmic point of view since Reed & De Freitas (2015) and Cai et. al (2017) among others have considered using execution traces.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] However the application to program repair is novel (as far as I know).[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\nSignificance: This work can be very useful for an educational platform though a limitation is the need for adding instrumentation print statements by hand.[[FWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n---\n\nSome questions/comments:\n- Do we need to add the print statements for any new programs that the students submit?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] What if the structure of the submitted program doesn't match the structure of the intended solution and hence adding print statements cannot be automated?[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n---\n\nReferences \n\nCai, J., Shin, R., & Song, D.
