"The submitted manuscript describes an exercise in performance comparison for neural language models under standardization of the hyperparameter tuning and model selection strategies and costs.[[INT-POS], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] This type of study is important to give perspective to non-standardized performance scores reported across separate publications,[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [SMY], [GEN]] and indeed the results here are interesting as they favour relatively simpler structures.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nI have a favourable impression of this paper[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [APC,FBK], [MAJ]] but would hope another reviewer is more familiar with the specific application domain than I am."[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]
