"The paper discusses ways to guard against adversarial domain shifts with so-called counterfactual regularization.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The main idea is that in several datasets there are many instances of images for the same object/person, and that taking this into account by learning a classifier that is invariant to the superficial changes (or \u201cstyle\u201d features, e.g. hair color, lighting, rotation etc.) can improve the robustness and prediction accuracy.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors show the benefit of this approach, as opposed to the naive way of just using all images without any grouping, in several toy experimental settings.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nAlthough I really wanted to like the paper, I have several concerns, First and most importantly, the paper is not citing several important related work.[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Especially, I have the impression that the paper is focusing on a very similar setting (causally) to the one considered in  [Gong et al. 2016] (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gong16.html), as can be seen from Fig. 1. Although not focusing on classification directly, this paper also tries to a function T(X) such that P(Y|T(X)) is invariant to domain change.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [CRT], [GEN]] Moreover, in that paper, the authors assume that even the distribution of the class can be changed in the different domains (or interventions in this paper).33.07[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\nBesides, there are also other less related papers, e.g. http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/zhang13d.pdf, https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/view/10052/0, https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09724, (or potentially https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05333 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06422), that I think may be mentioned for a more complete picture.[[RWK-NEG,BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] Since there is some related work, it may be also worth to compare with it, or use the same datasets.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nI\u2019m also not very happy with the term \u201ccounterfactual\u201d. As the authors mention in footnote, this is not the correct use of the term, since counterfactual means \u201cagainst the fact\u201d.[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] For example, a counterfactual query is \u201cwe gave the patient a drug and the patient died, what would have happened if we didn\u2019t give the drug?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]]\u201d In this case, these are just different interventions on possibly the same object.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] I\u2019m not sure that in the practical applications one can assure that the noise variables stay the same, which, as the authors correctly mention, would make it a bit closer to counterfactuals.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It may sound pedantic, but I don\u2019t understand why use the wrong and confusing terminology for no specific reason, also because in practice the paper reduces to the simple idea of finding a classifier that doesn\u2019t vary too much in the different images of the single object.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n**EDIT**: I was satisfied with the clarifications from the authors and I appreciated the changes that they did with respect to the related work and terminology, so I changed my evaluation from a 5 (marginally below threshold) to a 7 (good paper, accept)."[[RWK-POS,OAL-POS], [REC-POS], [FBK], [MAJ]]
