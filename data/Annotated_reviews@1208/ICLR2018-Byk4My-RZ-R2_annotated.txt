"The paper demonstrates the need and usage for flexible priors in the latent space alongside current priors used for the generator network.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] These priors are indirectly induced from the data - the example discussed is via an empirical diagonal covariance assumption for a multivariate Gaussian. [[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]The experimental results show the benefits of this approach.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \nThe paper provides for a good read.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nComments:\n\n1. How do the PAG scores differ when using a full covariance structure?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]] Diagonal covariances are still very restrictive.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n2. The results are depicted with a latent space of 20 dimensions.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [MAJ]] It will be informative to see how the model holds in high-dimensional settings.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] And when data can be sparse. [[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n3. You could consider giving the Discriminator, real data etc in Fig 1 for completeness as a graphical summary.[[DAT-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] \n"
