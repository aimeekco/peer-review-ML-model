"This paper studies a toy problem: a random binary image is generated, and treated as a maze (1=wall, 0=freely moveable space).[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A random starting point is generated.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The task is to learn whether the center pixel is reachable from the starting point.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nA deep architechture is proposed to solve the problem: see fig 1.[[TNF-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] A conv net on the image is combined with that on a state image, the state being interpreted as rechable pixels.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] This can work if each layer expands the reachable region (the state) by one pixel if the pixel is not blocked.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nTwo local minima are observed: 1) the network ignores stucture and guesses if the task is solvable by aggregate statistics[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] 2) it works as described above but propagates the rechable region on a checkerboard only.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper is chiefly concerned with analysing these local minima by expanding the cost function about them.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]  This analysis is hard to follow for non experts graph theory.[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  This is partly because many non-trivial results are mentioned with little or no explanation.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nThe paper is hard to evaluate.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  The actual setup seems somewhat arbitrary,[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  but the method of analysing the failure modes is interesting.[[MET-POS,ANA-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  It may inspire more useful research in the future.[[ANA-POS,FWK-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nIf we trust the authors, then the paper seems good because it is fairly unusual.[[OAL-NEU], [NOV-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  But it is hard to determine whether the analysis is correct."[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
