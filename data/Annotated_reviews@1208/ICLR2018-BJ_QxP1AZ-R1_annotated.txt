"My main concern for this paper is that the description of the Visual Concepts is completely unclear for me.[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] At some point I thought I did understand it, but then the next equation didnt make sense anymore...[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  If I understand correctly, f_p is a representation of *all images* of a specific layer *k* at/around pixel \"p\", (According to last line of page 3).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  That would make sense, given that then the dimensions of the vector f_p is a scalar (activation value) per image for that image, in layer k, around pixel p.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  Then f_v is one of the centroids (named VCs).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  However, this doesnt seem to be the case, given that it is impossible to construct VC activations for specific images from this definition.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  So, it should be something else, but it does not become clear, what this f_p is.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  This is crucial in order to follow / judge the rest of the paper.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Still I give it a try.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nSection 4.1 is the second most important section of the paper, where properties of VCs are discussed.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]  It has a few shortcomings. [[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] First, iIt is unclear why coverage should be >=0.8 and firerate ~ 1, according to the motivation firerate should equal to coverage: that is each pixel f_p is assigned to a single VC centroid.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Second, \"VCs tent to occur for a specific class\", that seems rather a bold statement from a 6 class, 3 VCs experiment, where the class sensitivity is in the order 40-77%.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]  Also the second experiment, which shows the spatial clustering for the \"car wheel\" VC, is unclear, how is the name \"car wheel\" assigned to the VC?[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN,CRT], [MAJ]]  That has have to be named after the EM process, given that EM is unsupervised.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  Finally the cost effectiveness training (3c), how come that the same \"car wheel\" (as in 3b) is discovered by the EM clustering? Is that coincidence?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Or is there some form of supervision involved?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\n\nMinor remarks\n- Table 1: the reported results of the Matching Network are different from the results in the paper of Vinyals (2016).[[RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- It is unclear what the influence of the smoothing is, and how the smoothing parameter is estimated / set.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- The VCs are introduced for few-shot classification, unclear how this is different from \"previous few-shot methods\" (sect 5).[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n- 36x36 patches have a plausible size within a 84x84 image, this is rather large, do semantic parts really cover 20% of the image?[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] \n- How are the networks trained, with what objective, how validated, which training images?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  What is the influence of the layer on the performance?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  \n- Influence of the clustering method on VCs, eg k-means, gaussian, von-mises (the last one is proposed)?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nOn a personal note, I've difficulties with part of the writing. [[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]For example, the introduction is written rather \"arrogant\" (not completely the right word, sorry for that), with a sentence, like \"we have only limited insights into why CNNs are effective\" seems overkill for the main research body.[[INT-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] The used Visual Concepts (VCs) were already introduced by other works (Wangt'15), and is not a novelty.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Also the authors refer to another paper (about using VCs for detection) which is also under submission (somewhere).[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] Finally, the introduction paragraph of Section 5 is rather bold, \"resembles the learning process of human beings\"?[[CNT], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Not so sure that is true, and it is not supported by a reference (or an experiment).[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\nIn conclusion:\nThis paper presents a method for creating features from a (pre-trained) ConvNet.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \nIt clusters features from a specific pooling layer, and then creates a binary assignment between per image extracted feature vectors and the cluster centroids.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] These are used in a 1-NN classifier and a (smoothed) Naive Bayes classifier.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The results show promising results,[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] yet lack exploration of the model, at least to draw conclusions like \"we address the challenge of understanding the internal visual cues of CNNs\".[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] I believe this paper needs to focus on the working of the VCs for few-shot experiments, showing the influences of some of the choices (layer, network layout, smoothing, clustering, etc).[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MAJ]] Moreover, the introduction should be rewritten, and the the background section of VCs (Sect 3) should be clarified.[[INT-NEG,MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Therefore, I rate the current manuscript as a reject.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG], [FBK], [MAJ]] \n\nAfter rebuttal:\nThe writing of the paper greatly improved, still missing insights (see comments below).[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Therefore I've upgraded my rating, and due to better understanding now, als my confidence.
