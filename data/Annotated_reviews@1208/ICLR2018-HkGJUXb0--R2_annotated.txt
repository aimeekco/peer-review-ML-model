"This paper proposes a tensor train decomposition with a ring structure for function approximation and data compression.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Most of the techniques used are well-known in the tensor community (outside of machine learning).[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The main contribution of the paper is the introduce such techniques to the ML community and presents experimental results for support.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS,EXP-POS,RES-POS], [SUB-POS,IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe paper is rather preliminary in its examination.[[RWK-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] For example, it is claimed that the proposed decomposition provides \"enhanced representation ability\", but this is not justified rigorously either via more comprehensive experimentation or via a theoretical justification.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]] Furthermore, the paper lacks in novelty aspect, as it is uses mostly well-known techniques.[[PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG,SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] "
