"This work explores some approaches in the object detection field of computer vision: (a) a soft attention map based on the activations on convolutional layers, (b) a classification regarding the location of an object in a 3x3 grid over the image, (c) an autoencoder that the authors claim to be aware of the multiple object instances in the image.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] These three proposals are presented in a framework of a robot vision module, although neither the experiments nor the dataset correspond to this domain.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [GEN]]\n\nFrom my perspective, the work is very immature and seems away from current state of the art on object detection, both in the vocabulary, performance or challenges.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,REC-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] The proposed techniques are assessed in a dataset which is not described and whose results are not compared with any other technique.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]] This important flaw in the evaluation prevents any fair comparison with the state of the art.[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [DFT], [GEN]]\n\nThe text is also difficult to follow. The three contributions seem disconnected and could have been presented in separate works with a more deeper discussion.[[RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [SUG], [GEN]] In particular, I have serious problems understanding:\n\n1. What is exactly the contribution of the CNN pre-trained with IMageNet when learning the soft-attention maps ?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] The reference to a GAN architecture seems very forced and out of the scope.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DFT,DIS], [MIN]]\n\n2. What is the interest of the localization network ? The task it addresses seems very simple and in any case it requires a manual annotation of a dataset of objects in each of the predefined locations in the 3x3 grid.[[MET-NEG], [null], [DIS,QSN], [MIN]]\n\n3. The authors talk about an autoencoder architecture, but also on a classification network where the labels correspond to the object count. I could not undertstand what is exactly assessed in this section.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n\nFinally, the authors violate the double-bind review policy by clearly referring to their previous work on Experiental Robot Learning.[[RWK-NEG], [null], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\nI would encourage the authors to focus in one of the research lines they point in the paper and go deeper into it, with a clear understanding of the state of the art and the specific challenges these state of the art techniques may encounter in the case of robotic vision."[[RWK-NEG], [null], [FBK], [GEN]]
