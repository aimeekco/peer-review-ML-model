"Overall, this work seems like a reasonable attempt to answer the question of how the empirical loss landscape relates to the true population loss landscape.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  The analysis answers:\n\n1) When empirical gradients are close to true gradients\[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]n2) When empirical isolated saddle points are close to true isolated saddle points[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n3) When the empirical risk is close to the true risk.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nThe answers are all of the form that if the number of training examples exceeds a quantity that grows with the number of layers, width and the exponential of the norm of the weights with respect to depth, then empirical quantities will be close to true quantities.[[RES-NEU,DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]  I have not verified the proofs in this paper (given short notice to review) but the scaling laws in the upper bounds found seem reasonably correct.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nAnother reviewer's worry about why depth plays a role in the convergence of empirical to true values in deep linear networks is a reasonable worry, but I suspect that depth will necessarily play a role even in deep linear nets because the backpropagation of gradients in linear nets can still lead to exponential propagation of errors between empirical and true quantities due to finite training data.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS,EXT-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  Moreover the loss surface of deep linear networks depends on depth even though the expressive capacity does not.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]   An analysis of dynamics on this loss surface was presented in Saxe et. al. ICLR 2014 which could be cited to address that reviewer's concern.[[RWK-NEU,EXT-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]  However, the reviewer's suggestion that the results be compared to what is known more exactly for simple linear regression is a nice one.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU,EXT-POS], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \n\nOverall, I believe this paper is a nice contribution to the deep learning theory literature.[[OAL-POS], [APR-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However,  it would even better to help the reader with more intuitive statements about the implications of their results for practice, and the gap between their upper bounds and practice, especially given the intense interest in the generalization error problem.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]   Because their upper bounds look similar to those based on Rademacher complexity or VC dimension (although they claim theirs are a little tighter) - they should put numbers in to their upper bounds taken from trained neural networks, and see what the numerical evaluation of their upper bounds turn out to be in situations of practical interest where deep networks show good generalization performance despite having significantly less training data than number of parameters.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  I suspect their upper bounds will be loose,[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DIS], [MIN]] but still  - it would be an excellent contribution to the literature to quantitatively compare theory and practice with bounds that are claimed to be slightly tigher than previous bounds.[[FWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]  Even if they are loose - identifying the degree of looseness could inspire interesting future work. \n"
