"The paper was a good contribution to domain adaptation. It provided a new way of looking at the problem by using the cluster assumption.[[INT-POS], [null], [SMY], [MAJ]] The experimental evaluation was very thorough and shows that VADA and DIRT-T performs really well. [[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nI found the math to be a bit problematic. For example, L_d in (4) involves a max operator. Although I understand what the authors mean, I don't think this is the correct way to write this. (5) should discuss the min-max objective.[[MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT,DIS], [MAJ]] This will probably involve an explanation of the gradient reversal etc. Speaking of GRL, it's mentioned on p.6 that they replaced GRL with the traditional GAN objective.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]] This is actually pretty important to discuss in detail: did that change the symmetric nature of domain-adversarial training to the asymmetric nature of traditional GAN training? Why was that important to the authors?[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\nThe literature review could also include Shrivastava et al. and Bousmalis et al. from CVPR 2017. The latter also had MNIST/MNIST-M experiments."[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null], [SUG], [MIN]]
