"This paper presents a model to encode and decode trees in distributed representations.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] \nThis is not the first attempt of doing these encoders and decoders.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] However, there is not a comparative evalution with these methods.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU,CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\nIn fact, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to encode and decode trees in distributed structures without learning parameters, see \"Decoding Distributed Tree Structures\" and \"Distributed tree kernels\".[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\nThe paper should present a comparison with such kinds of models.\n"[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]
