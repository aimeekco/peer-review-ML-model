"The authors present a method that aims to remove domain-specific information while preserving the relevant biological information between biological data measured in different experiments or \"batches\".[[INT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] A network is trained to learn the transformations that minimize the Wasserstein distance between distributions.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The wasserstein distance is also called the \"earth mover distance\" and is traditionally formulated as the cost it takes for an optimal transport plan to move one distribution to another.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] In this paper they have a neural network compute the wasserstein distance using a different formulation that was used in Arjovsky et al. 2017, finds a lipschitz function f, which shows the maximal difference when evaluated on samples from the two distributions.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Here these functions are formulated as affine transforms of the data with parameters theta that are computed by a neural network.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Results are examined mainly by looking at the first two PCA components of the data.[[RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  \n\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea and is fairly well written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However I have a few concerns:\n1. Most of the ideas presented in the paper rely on works by Arjovsky et al. (2017), Gulrajani et al. (2017), and Gulrajani et al. (2017).[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [CRT], [MIN]] Some selections, which are presented in the papers are not explained, for example, the gradient penalty, the choice of \\lambda and the choice of points for gradient computation.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MIN]]\n2. The experimental results are not fully convincing, they simply compare the first two PC components on this Broad Bioimage benchmark collection.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] This section could be improved by demonstrating the approach on more datasets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU, EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n3. There is a lack comparison to other methods such as Shaham et al. (2017).[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] Why is using earth mover distance better than MMD based distance?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] They only compare it to a method named CORAL and to Typical\nVariation Normalization (TVN).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]  What about comparison to other batch normalization methods in biology such as SEURAT? [[EXT-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]] \n4. Why is the affine transform assumption valid in biology?  [[EXT-NEU], [null], [QSN], [GEN]]There can definitely be non-linear effects that are different between batches, such as ion detection efficiency differences.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] \n5. Only early stopping seems to constrain their model to be near identity.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] Doesn't this also prevent optimal results ?[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] How does this compare to the near-identity constraints in resnets in Shaham et al. ?\n\n"[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
