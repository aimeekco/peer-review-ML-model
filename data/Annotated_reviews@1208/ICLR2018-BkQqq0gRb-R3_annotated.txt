"The paper describes the problem of continual learning, the non-iid nature of most real-life data and point out to the catastrophic forgetting phenomena in deep learning.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The work defends the point of view that Bayesian inference is the right approach to attack this problem and address difficulties in past implementations.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper is well written,[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] the problem is described neatly in conjunction with the past work,[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] and the proposed algorithm is supported by experiments.[[EXP-POS,MET-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The work is a useful addition to the communit[[OAL-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]y.\n\nMy main concern focus on the validity of the proposed model in harder tasks such as the Atari experiments in Kirkpatrick et. al. (2017) or the split CIFAR experiments in Zenke et. al. (2017). [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,BIB-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]]Even though the experiments carried out in the paper are important, they fall short of justifying a major step in the direction of the solution for the continual learning problem."[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]
