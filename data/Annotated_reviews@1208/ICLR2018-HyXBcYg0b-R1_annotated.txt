"The authors revised the paper according to all reviewers suggestions, I am satisfied with the current version.[[OAL-POS], [CNT], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nSummary: this works proposes to employ recurrent gated convnets to solve graph node labeling problems on arbitrary graphs.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It build upon several previous works, successively introducing convolutional networks, gated edges convnets on graphs, and LSTMs on trees.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The authors extend the tree LSTMs formulation to perform graph labeling on arbitrary graphs, merge convnets with residual connections and edge gating mechanisms.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] They apply the 2 proposed models to 3 baselines also based on graph neural networks on two problems: sub-graph matching (expressing the problem of sub-graph matching as a node classification problem), and semi supervised clustering.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]  \n\nMain comments:\nIt would strengthen the paper to also compare all these network learning based approaches to variational ones.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] For instance, to a spectral clustering method for the semi supervised clustering, or\nsolving the combinatorial Dirichlet problem as in Grady: random walks for image segmentation, 2006.[[RWK-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nThe abstract and the conclusion should be revised, they are very vague.[[ABS-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]\n- The abstract should be self contained and should not contain citations.[[ABS-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]\n- The authors should clarify which problem they are dealing with.[[PDI-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n- instead of the \"numerical result show the performance of the new model\", give some numerical results here, otherwise, this sentence is useless.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MAJ]]\n- we propose ... as propose -> unclear: what do you propose?[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n \n\nMinor comments:\n- You should make sentences when using references with the author names format.[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] Example: ... graph theory, Chung (1997) -> graph theory by Chung (1997)[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]]\n- As Eq 2 -> As the minimization of Eq 2 (same with eq 4)\n- Don't start sentences with And, or But\n\n"[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]
