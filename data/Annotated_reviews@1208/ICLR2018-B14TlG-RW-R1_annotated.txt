"Summary:\n\nThis paper proposes a non-recurrent model for reading comprehension which used only convolutions and attention.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The goal is to avoid recurrent which is sequential and hence a bottleneck during both training and inference.[[PDI-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Authors also propose a paraphrasing based data augmentation method which helps in improving the performance.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Proposed method performs better than existing models in SQuAD dataset while being much faster in training and inference.[[RWK-POS,DAT-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nMy Comments:\n\nThe proposed model is convincing and the paper is well written.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n1. Why don\u2019t you report your model performance without data augmentation in Table 1?[[EXP-NEU,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU,EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is it because it does not achieve SOTA?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] The proposed data augmentation is a general one and it can be used to improve the performance of other models as well.[[MET-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] So it does not make sense to compare your model + data augmentation against other models without data augmentation.[[MET-NEG], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] I think it is ok to have some deterioration in the performance as you have a good speedup when compared to other models.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n2. Can you mention your leaderboard test accuracy in the rebuttal?\n\n[[RES-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]3. The paper can be significantly strengthened by adding at least one more reading comprehension dataset.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] That will show the generality of the proposed architecture.[[RES-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] Given the sufficient time for rebuttal, I am willing to increase my score if authors report results in an additional dataset in the revision.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [FBK], [MAJ]]\n\n4. Are you willing to release your code to reproduce the results?\[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. You mention 4X to 9X for inference speedup in abstract and then 4X to 10X speedup in Intro. Please be consistent.\[[INT-NEU], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]n2. In the first contribution bullet point, \u201cthat exclusive built upon\u201d should be \u201cthat is exclusively built upon\u201d.\n"[[CNT], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]
