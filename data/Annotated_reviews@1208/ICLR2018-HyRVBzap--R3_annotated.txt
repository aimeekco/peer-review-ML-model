[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]The recommended length is 8 pages + 1 page for citations.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] This paper is 12+1 pages long, plus a 5 page supplement.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I'd highly recommend the authors to cut a third of their text, it would help focus the paper on the actual message: pushing their new algorithm.[[MET-NEU,OAL-NEU], [SUB-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Try to remove any sentence or word that doesn't serve a purpose (help sell the algorithm).[[MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\nThe structure of the paper could also be improved.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] For example the cascade adversarial training is buried deep inside the experimental section.[[EXP-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] Considering that it is part of the title, I would have expected a proper exposition of the idea in the technical section (before any results are presented).[[INT-NEG,PDI-NEG,RES-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG], [MAJ]] While condensing the paper, consider presenting all technical material before evaluation.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]]\nFinally, the pivot \"loss\" seems a bit hacky.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] First, the pivot objective and bidirectional loss are exactly the same thing.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] While the bidirectional loss is a proper loss and optimized as such (by optimizing both E^adv and E), the pivot objective is no loss function, as it does not correspond to any function any optimization algorithm could minimize.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]] I'd recommend the just remove the pivot objective, or at least not call it a loss.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nIn summary, the results and presented method are good, and eventually deserve publication.[[MET-POS,RES-POS,OAL-POS], [REC-POS,EMP-POS], [APC,FBK], [MAJ]] However the exposition needs to significantly improve for the paper to be ready for ICLR."[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]
