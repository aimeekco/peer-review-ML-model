"This paper presents a sensitivity-penalized loss (the loss of the classifier has an additional term in squart of the gradient of the classifier w.r.t. perturbations of the inputs), and a minimax (or maximin) driven algorithm to find attacks and defenses.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] It has a lemma which claims that the \"minimax and the maximin solutions provide the best worst-case defense and attack models, respectively\", without proof, although that statement is supported experimentally.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n+ Prior work seem adequately cited and compared to, but I am not really knowledgeable in the adversarial attacks subdomain.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n- The experiments are on small/limited datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Because of this, confidence intervals (over different initializations, for instance) would be a nice addition to Table 5.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,TNF-NEU], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n- There is no exact (\"alternating optimization\" could be considered one) evaluation of the impact of the sensitivy loss vs. the minimax/maximin algorithm.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SMY], [GEN]]\n- The paper is hard to follow at times (and probably that dealing with the point above would help in this regard), e.g. Lemma 1 and experimental analysis.[[EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n- It is unclear (from Figures 3 and 7) that \"alternative optimization\" and \"minimax\" converged fully, and/or that the sets of hyperparameters were optimal.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]]\n+ This paper presents a game formulation of learning-based attacks and defense in the context of adversarial examples for neural networks, and empirical findings support its claims.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\n\nNitpicks:\nthe gradient descent -> gradient descent or the gradient descent algorithm\nseeming -> seemingly\narbitrary flexible -> arbitrarily flexible\ncan name \"gradient descent that maximizes\": gradient ascent.\nThe mini- max or the maximin solution is defined -> are defined\nis the follow -> is the follower\n"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]
