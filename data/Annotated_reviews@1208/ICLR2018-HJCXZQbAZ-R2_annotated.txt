"The paper presents a study on the use of density embedding for modeling hierarchical semantic relations, and in particular on the hypernym one.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The goal is to capture hypernyms of some synsets, even if their occurrence is scarce on the training data.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]]\n+++pros: 1) potentially a good idea, capable of filling an ontology of relations scarcely present in a given repository[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] 2) solid theoretical ackground,[[CNT], [null], [APC], [MAJ]] even if no methodological novelty has been introduced (this is also a cons!)[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT,CRT], [MAJ]]\n---cons: 1) Badly presented: the writing of the paper fails in let the reader aware of what the paper actually serves\[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]n\nCOMMENTS:\nThe introduction puzzled me:  the authors, once they stated the problem (the scarceness of the hypernyms' occurrences in the texts w.r.t. their hyponyms), proposed a solution which seems not to directly solve this problem.[[INT-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] So I suggest the authors to better explain the connection between the told problem and their proposed solution, and how this can solve the problem.[[PDI-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]\n\nThis aspect is also present in the experiments section, since it is not possible to understand how much the problem (the scarceness of the hypernyms) is present in the HYPERLEX dataset.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]]\n\nHow the 4000 hypernyms have been selected?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Why a diagonal covariance has been estimated, and not a full covariance one?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n\nn Figure 4 middle, it is not clear whether the location and city concepts are intersecting the other synsets.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It shouldn't be, but the authors should spend a little on this.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nApart from these comments, I found the paper interesting especially for the big amount fo comparisons carried out.[[OAL-POS], [SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] \n\nAs a final general comment, I would have appreciated a paper more self explanative, without referring to the paper [Vilnis & McCallum, 2014] which makes appear the paper a minor improvement of what it is actually.
