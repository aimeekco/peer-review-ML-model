"General comment\n==============\nLow-rank decomposing convolutional filters has been used to speedup convolutional networks at the cost of a drop in prediction performance.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The authors a) extended existing decomposition techniques by an iterative method for decomposition and fine-tuning convolutional filter weights, and b) and algorithm to determine the rank of each convolutional filter.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors show that their method enables a higher speedup and lower accuracy drop than existing methods when applied to VGG16.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] The proposed method is a useful extension of existing methods but needs to evaluated more rigorously.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] The manuscript is hard to read due to unclear descriptions and grammatical errors.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\nMajor comments\n=============\n1. The authors authors showed that their method enables a higher speedup and lower drop in accuracy than existing methods when applied to VGG16..[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] The authors should analyze if this also holds true for ResNet and Inception, which are more widely used than VGG16.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n2. The authors measured the actual speedup on a single CPU (Intel Core i5)..[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] The authors should measure the actual speedup also on a single GPU.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n3. It is unclear how the actual speedup was measured.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Does it correspond to the seconds per update step or the overall training time?.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] In the latter case, how long were models trained?.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\n4. How and which hyper-parameters were optimized?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]The authors should use the same hyper-parameters for all methods (Jaderberg, Zhang, Rank selection).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] The authors should also analyze the sensitivity of speedup and accuracy drop depending on the learning rate for \u2018Rank selection\u2019.[[ANA-NEU,RES-NEU], [SUB-NEU,CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n5. Figure 4: the authors should show the same plot for more convolutional layers at varying depth from both VGG and ResNet.[[DAT-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n6. The manuscript is hard to understand and not written clearly enough.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] In the abstract, what does \u2018two-pass decomposition\u2019, \u2018proper ranks\u2019, \u2018the instability problem\u2019, or \u2018systematic\u2019 mean?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] What are \u2018edge devices\u2019, \u2018vanilla parameters\u2019?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] The authors should also avoid uninformative adjectives, clutter, and vague terms throughout the manuscript such as \u2018vital importance\u2019 or \u2018little room for fine-tuning\u2019.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]]\n\nMinor comments\n=============\n1. The authors should use \u2018significantly\u2019 only if a statistical hypothesis was performed.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n2. The manuscript contains several typos and grammatical flaws, e.g. \u2018have been widely applied to have the breakthrough\u2019, \u2018The CP decomposition factorizes the tensors into a sum of series rank-one tensors.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\u2019, \u2018Our two-pass decomposition provides the better result as compared with the original CP decomposition\u2019.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n\n3. For clarity, the authors should express equation 5 in terms of Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, and Y_4.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n4. Equation 2, bottom: C_in, W_f, H_f, and C_out are undefined at this point."[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]
