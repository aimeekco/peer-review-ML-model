"The paper proposes a method which jointly learns the label embedding (in the form of class similarity) and a classification model.[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] While the motivation of the paper makes sense, the model is not properly justified, and I learned very little after reading the paper.[[PDI-POS,MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG], [DFT], [MAJ]]\n\nThere are 5 terms in the proposed objective function. There are also several other parameters associated with them: for example, the label temperature of z_2\u2019\u2019 and and parameter alpha in the second last term etc.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nFor all the experiments, the same set of parameters are used, and it is claimed that \u201cthe method is robust in our experiment and simply works without fine tuning\u201d.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [SMY], [GEN]] While I agree that a robust and fine-tuning-free model is ideal 1) this has to be justified by experiment. 2) showing the experiment with different parameters will help us understand the role each component plays.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]] This is perhaps more important than improving the baseline method by a few point, especially given that the goal of this work is not to beat the state-of-the-art.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]"
