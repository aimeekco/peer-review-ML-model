"The authors clearly describe the problem being addressed in the manuscript and motivate their solution very clearly.[[PDI-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  The proposed solution seems very intuitive and the empirical evaluations demonstrates its utility. [[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] My main concern is the underlying assumption (if I understand correctly) that the adversarial attack technique that the detector has to handle needs to be available at the training time of the detector.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  Especially since the empirical evaluations are designed in such a way where the training and test data for the detector are perturbed with the same attack technique.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] However, this does not invalidate the contributions of this manuscript.[[OAL-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\nSpecific comments/questions:\n- (Minor) Page 3, Eq 1: I think the expansion dimension cares more about the probability mass in the volume rather than the volume itself even in the Euclidean setting.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- Section 4: The different pieces of the problem (estimation, intuition for adversarial subspaces, efficiency) are very well described.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [CRT], [MIN]]\n- Alg 1, L3: Is this where the normal exmaples are converted to adversarial examples using some attack technique?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MIN]] \n- Alg 1, L12: Is LID_norm computed using a leave-one-out estimate?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Otherwise, r_1(.) for each point is 0, leading to a somewhat \"under-estimate\" of the true LID of the normal points in the training set.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] I understand that it is not an issue in the test set.[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n- Section 4 and Alg 1: S we do not really care about the \"labels/targets\" of the examples.[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] All examples in the dataset are considered \"normal\" to start with.[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]  Is this assuming that the \"initial training set\" which is used to obtain the \"pre-trained DNN\" free of adversarial examples?[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] \n- Section 5, Experimental Setup: Seems like normal points in the test set would get lesser values if we are not doing the \"leave-one-out\" version of the estimation.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] \n- Section 5: The authors have done a great job at evaluating every aspect of the proposed method.\n"[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]
