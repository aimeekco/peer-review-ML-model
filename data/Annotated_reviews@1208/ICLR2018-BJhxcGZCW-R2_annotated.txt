"The authors suggest using a variational autoencoder to infer binary relationships between medical entities.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The model is quite simple and intuitive and the authors demonstrate that it can generate meaningful relationships between pairs of entities that were not observed before.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]  \nWhile the paper is very well-written[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] I have certain concerns regarding the motivation, model, and evaluation methodology followed:[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [null], [CRT], [GEN]]\n\n1) A stronger motivation for this model is required.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Having a generative model for causal relationships between symptoms and diseases is \"intriguing\" yet I am really struggling with the motivation of getting such a model from word co-occurences in a medical corpus.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I can totally buy the use of the proposed model as means to generate additional training data for a discriminative model used for information extraction but the authors need to do a better job at explaining the downstream applications of their model.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n2) The word embeddings used seem to be sufficient to capture the \"knowledge\" included in the corpus.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] An ablation study of the impact of word embeddings on this model is required.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] \n\n3) The authors do not describe how the data from xywy.com were annotated.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Were they annotated by experts in the medical domain or random users?[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN], [MAJ]]\n\n4) The metric of quality is particularly ad-hoc.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] Meaningful relationships in a medical domain and evaluation using random amazon mechanical turk workers do not seem to go well together.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ] \n\n5) How does the proposed methods compare against a simple trained extractor?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN] For instance one can automatically extract several linguistic features of the sentences two known related entities appeared with and learn how to extract data.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN] The authors need to compare against such baselines or justify why they cannot be used.\n"[[DAT-NEG,RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]
