"The paper presents an interesting spectral algorithm for multiscale hmm[[INT-POS], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]. The derivation and analysis seems correct.[[MET-POS,ANA-POS], [null], [APC], [GEN]] However, it is well-known that spectral algorithm is not robust to model mis-specification.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [GEN]] It is not clear whether the proposed algorithm will be useful in practice.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] How will the method compare to EM algorithms and neural network based approaches?
