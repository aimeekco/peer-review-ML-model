"The paper proposes a general neural network structure that includes TC (temporal convolution) blocks and Attention blocks for meta-learning, specifically, for episodic task learning.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Through intensive experiments on various settings including few-shot image classification on Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet, and four reinforcement learning applications, the authors show that the proposed structure can achieve highly comparable performance wrt the corresponding specially designed state-of-the-art methods.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The experiment results seem solid and the proposed structure is with simple design and highly generalizable.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The concern is that the contribution is quite incremental from the theoretical side[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] though it involves large amount of experimental efforts, which could be impactful.[[EXP-POS,FWK-POS], [IMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] Please see the major comment below.\n\nOne major comment:\n- Despite that the work is more application oriented, the paper would have been stronger and more impactful if it includes more work on the theoretical side.[[MET-NEG,FWK-NEU], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEU], [SUG,CRT], [MIN]] \nSpecifically, for two folds: \n(1) in general, some more work in investigating the task space would be nice.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]] The paper assumes the tasks are \u201crelated\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d and thus transferrable; also particularly in Section 2, the authors define that the tasks follow the same distribution.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] But what exactly should the distribution be like to be learnable and how to quantify such \u201crelated\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d relationship across tasks? [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n(2) in particular, for each of the experiments that the authors conduct, it would be nice to investigate some more on when the proposed TC + Attention network would work better and thus should be used by the community; some questions to answer include: when should we prefer the proposed combination of TC + attention blocks over the other methods?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG,DIS], [MIN]] The result from the paper seems to answer with \u201cin all cases\u201d but then that always brings the issue of \u201coverfitting\u201d or parameter tuning issue.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] I believe the paper would have been much stronger if either of the two above are further investigated.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\nMore detailed comments:\n- On Page 1, \u201cthe optimal strategy for an arbitrary range of tasks\u201d lacks definition of \u201crange\u201d; also, in the setting in this paper, these tasks should share \u201csimilarity\u201d or follow the same \u201cdistribution\u201d and thus such \u201carbitrariness\u201d is actually constrained.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]]\n\n- On Page 2, the notation and formulation for the meta-learning could be more mathematically rigid; the distribution over tasks is not defined.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG], [DFT], [MIN]] It is understandable that the authors try to make the paradigm very generalizable; but the ambiguity or the abstraction over the \u201ctask distribution\u201d is too large to be meaningful.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] One suggestion would be to split into two sections, one for supervised learning and one for reinforcement learning; but both share the same design paradigm, which is generalizable.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n- For results in Table 1 and Table 2, how are the confidence intervals computed?[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Is it over multiple runs or within the same run?[[TNF-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] It would be nice to make clear; in addition, I personally prefer either reporting raw standard deviations or conduct hypothesis testing with specified tests.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] The confidence intervals may not be clear without elaboration; such is also concerning in the caption for Table 3 about claiming \u201cnot statistically-significantly different\u201d because no significance test is reported.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] \n\n- At last, some more details in implementation would be nice (package availability, run time analysis); I suppose the package or the source code would be publicly available afterwards?"[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]
