"This paper focuses on solving query completion problem with error correction which is a very practical and important problem. [[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]The idea is character based.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] And in order to achieve three important targets which are auto completion, auto error correction and real time, the authors first adopt the character-level RNN-based modeling which can be easily combined with error correction, and then carefully optimize the inference part to make it real time.[[MET-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\nPros:\n(1) the paper is very well organized and easy to read[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS], [APC], [MAJ]].\n(2) the proposed method is nicely designed to solve the specific real problem. For example, the edit distance is modified to be more consistent with the task.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n(3) detailed information are provided about the experiments, such as data, model and inference.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nCons:\n(1) No direct comparisons with other methods are provided.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I am not familiar with the state-of-the-art methods in this field.[[EXT-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MAJ]] If the performance (hit rate or coverage) of this paper is near stoa methods, then such experimental results will make this paper much more solid[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MAJ]]."
