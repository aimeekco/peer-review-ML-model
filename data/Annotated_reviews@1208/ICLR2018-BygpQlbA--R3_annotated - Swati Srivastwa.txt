"The paper presents a provable algorithm for controlling an unknown linear dynamical system (LDS).[[INT-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] Given the recent interest in (deep) reinforcement learning (combined with the lack of theoretical guarantees in this space), this is a very timely problem to study.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]] The authors provide a rigorous end-to-end analysis for the LDS setting, which is a mathematically clean yet highly non-trivial setup that has a long history in the controls field.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nThe proposed approach leverages recent work that gives a novel parametrization of control problems in the LDS setting.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] After estimating the values of this parametrization, the authors formulate the problem of finding optimal control inputs as a large convex problem.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [GEN]] The time and sample complexities of this approach are polynomial in all relevant parameters.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] The authors also highlight that their sample complexity depends only logarithmically on the time horizon T.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MAJ]] The paper focuses on the theoretical results and does not present experiments (the polynomials are also not elaborated further).[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]]\n\nOverall, I think it is important to study control problems from a statistical perspective, and the LDS setting is a very natural target.[[PDI-NEU], [null], [DIS], [GEN]] Moreover, I find the proposed algorithmic approach interesting.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS], [APC], [MAJ]] However, I am not sure if the paper is a good fit for ICLR since it is purely theoretical in nature and has no experiments.[[EXP-NEG,OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,APR-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]] I also have the following questions regarding the theoretical contributions:\n\n(A) The authors emphasize the logarithmic dependence on T.[[MET-NEU], [null], [DIS], [MIN]] However, the bounds also depend polynomially on L, and as far as I can tell, L can be polynomial in T for certain systems if we want to achieve a good overall cost.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]] It would be helpful if the authors could comment on the dependence between T and L.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]\n\n(B) Why does the bound in Theorem 2.4 become worse when there are some directions that do not contribute to the cost (the lambda dependence)?[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [QSN,CRT], [MIN]]\n\n(C) Do the authors expect that it will be straightforward to remove the assumption that A is symmetric, or is this an inherent limitation of the approach?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\nMoreover, I have the following comments:\n\n(1) Theorem 3.3 is currently not self-contained.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG], [CRT], [MIN]] It would enhance readability of the paper if the results were more self-contained.[[RES-NEU,OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]] (It is obviously good to cite results from prior work, but then it would be more clear if the results are invoked as is without modifications.)[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n(2) In Theorem 1.1, the notation is slightly unclear because B^T is only defined later.[[RES-NEU,OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU,EMP-NEU], [SUG], [MIN]]\n\n(3) In Section 1.2 (Tracking a known system): \"given\" instead of \"give\"[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n(4) In Section 1.2 (Optimal control): \"symmetric\" instead of \"symmetrics\"[[CNT], [CLA-NEG], [CRT], [MAJ]]\n\n(5) In Section 1.2 (Optimal control): the paper says \"rather than solving a recursive system of equations, we provide a formulation of control as a one-shot convex program\". Is this meant as a contrast to the work of Dean et al. (2017)?[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] Their abstract also claims to utilize a convex programming formulation.[[ABS-NEU], [null], [SMY], [GEN]]\n\n(6) Below Definition 2.3: What is capital X?[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n(7) In Definition 2.3: What does the parenthesis in \\phi_j(1) denote?[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n(8) Below Theorem 2.4: Why is Phi now nk x T instead of nk x nT as in Definition 2.3?[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]]\n\n(9) Lemma 3.2: Is \\hat{D} defined in the paper?[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU], [QSN], [MIN]] I assume that it involves \\hat{M}, but it would be good to formally define this notation."[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]
